<s> probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was sold to the public during the past week </s>
<s> for many reasons the demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company was tremendous </s>
<s> it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock </s>
<s> it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell </s>
<s> a measure of how hot the stock was can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began </s>

<s> first the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months driving stocks of all kinds up </s>
<s> both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast run-up </s>

<s> for crucial encounter </s>
<s> one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev </s>
<s> mr kennedy replied </s>
<s> the president knew that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable </s>
<s> he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u s and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy </s>
<s> last friday the white house announced </s>
<s> the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in east-west relations </s>
<s> but mr kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe </s>
<s> that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting </s>
<s> despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war </s>
<s> road to vienna </s>
<s> the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east </s>
<s> pre-inaugural position </s>
<s> thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president mr kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem </s>
<s> shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words </s>
<s> the president had set for himself the task which he believed vital of awakening the u s and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance </s>
<s> he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary </s>
<s> he wanted time too to review the united states global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating </s>
<s> attitude flexible </s>
<s> at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader </s>
<s> ideally he knew it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels </s>
<s> but mr kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it </s>
<s> moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u s was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions </s>
<s> it dealt mainly with a broad range of east-west issues </s>
<s> but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted </s>
<s> developments over the next two months however caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing </s>
<s> there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly </s>
<s> deadlock on tests </s>
<s> the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva </s>
<s> in the u s strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing </s>
<s> mr kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament </s>
<s> there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons particularly to communist china </s>
<s> the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent </s>
<s> moreover moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies including the u n secretariat and the international control commission for laos </s>
<s> mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible </s>
<s> developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting </s>
<s> initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting </s>
<s> in cuba the u s had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep </s>
<s> in laos the picture was almost equally bad </s>
<s> as a result the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure </s>
<s> in the light of those events there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself </s>
<s> he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out </s>
<s> the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back </s>
<s> the response from london paris and bonn was favorable </s>
<s> firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week </s>
<s> the washington announcement said </s>
<s> the outlook </s>
<s> the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u s of both approval and disapproval </s>
<s> the approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at vienna </s>
<s> the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations </s>
<s> but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary </s>
<s> mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men </s>
<s> the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause </s>
<s> apart from the personal equation another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the us appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit </s>
<s> premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway </s>
<s> this time the initiative came in part at least from washington </s>
<s> other allies consulted </s>
<s> there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders </s>
<s> thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity </s>
<s> there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world </s>
<s> if tests are to be resumed the argument went it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union </s>
<s> disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse </s>
<s> the question was raised for example as to what attitude the president would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east </s>
<s> there are so my biologist friends tell me mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory </s>
<s> mollusks are a case in point </s>
<s> the shell which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended to cancel out the possibility of future development </s>
<s> though this may or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education </s>
<s> there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities </s>
<s> the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that </s>
<s> by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence </s>
<s> there is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture </s>
<s> viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university </s>
<s> but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project </s>
<s> certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy </s>
<s> official encouragement is one thing but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds </s>
<s> american catholics have responded generously to bishops and pastors appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning </s>
<s> they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made </s>
<s> diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility </s>
<s> all of this may be understandable enough it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise </s>
<s> yet for better or for worse the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities </s>
<s> community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible </s>
<s> it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment </s>
<s> a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere </s>
<s> the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension </s>
<s> the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship </s>
<s> had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees </s>
<s> it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas </s>
<s> this is not an isolated example </s>
<s> this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough </s>
<s> it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot </s>
<s> and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement </s>
<s> but in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one </s>
<s> there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university </s>
<s> in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel </s>
<s> word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession much given to attending meetings and conferences </s>
<s> expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype </s>
<s> in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere </s>
<s> to appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service </s>
<s> much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure </s>
<s> this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated </s>
<s> when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services </s>
<s> just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions </s>
<s> adequate compensation is indispensable </s>
<s> broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university </s>
<s> there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels </s>
<s> the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution </s>
<s> but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation </s>
<s> this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure </s>
<s> yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order </s>
<s> the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority </s>
<s> competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students illusion that they are making their own decisions </s>
<s> in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all </s>
<s> sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws </s>
<s> once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally </s>
<s> the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program </s>
<s> in addition disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill </s>
<s> it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but he pays the employers strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike </s>
<s> rep frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee </s>
<s> the committee remains unresponsive </s>
<s> neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter </s>
<s> they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions </s>
<s> the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained </s>
<s> the anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely undefined lines </s>
<s> it must play a game in which there never is a winner </s>
<s> the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law </s>
<s> hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy </s>
<s> let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which general electric westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market </s>
<s> the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment </s>
<s> accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price </s>
<s> naturally enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time </s>
<s> should these giants really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only survivors in the industry </s>
<s> under the circumstances the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted </s>
<s> engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants </s>
<s> the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows </s>
<s> in other words the anti-trust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday thursday and saturday </s>
<s> in this manner every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws </s>
<s> a plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license </s>
<s> if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest </s>
<s> a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle </s>
<s> however one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational </s>
<s> those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform </s>
<s> the wagner act the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining </s>
<s> the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition </s>
<s> if a union cannot perform this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud </s>
<s> the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession </s>
<s> the problem must be faced squarely </s>
<s> eighteenth-century england upon whose customs our common law was built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies </s>
<s> there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining but against labor monopoly </s>
<s> the courts shared the opinion of the employers </s>
<s> in people vs fisher justice savage of the new york supreme court declared </s>
<s> senator mcclellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation </s>
<s> paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act </s>
<s> indeed it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws </s>
<s> for example the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers </s>
<s> at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates </s>

<s> it was most effective against trade unions </s>

<s> the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer </s>
<s> player was the first to feel its teeth </s>
<s> as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course player was almost in tears </s>
<s> palmer had started the round four strokes behind player and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes </s>

<s> but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression </s>

<s> he did seem hasty on his second and third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out giving palmer a chance to recover his composure which he had quite visibly lost </s>
<s> palmer was now putting merely for a tie and player who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt </s>

<s> but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere </s>
<s> on the final round at pensacola the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come </s>

<s> it was a dismal drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course </s>
<s> the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences </s>
<s> on friday a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus </s>
<s> as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender </s>

<s> at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property </s>

<s> the colony was administered from brussels with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote </s>
<s> the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock </s>
<s> had they been truly ruthless the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion </s>
<s> but they were not </s>
<s> they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes </s>
<s> their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent </s>
<s> they put much effort into public housing </s>
<s> they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food </s>
<s> the belgians also placed great emphasis on education </s>
<s> but almost all the schools were primary </s>
<s> but they did not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college </s>
<s> indeed the belgians discouraged higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest </s>
<s> in one large oversimplification it might be said that the belgians felt far too late the gale of nationalism sweeping africa </s>

<s> behind this reply and its many variations is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest </s>
<s> most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate </s>
<s> the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse </s>
<s> confronted with this situation most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds </s>
<s> in some parts of the country however a co-operative movement has begun to grow under the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the state libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis </s>
<s> new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow </s>
<s> because it is so large a state with marked contrasts in population density the organization of the new york co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works </s>
<s> at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated area </s>
<s> at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system in a high-density area with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve </s>
<s> under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts </s>
<s> an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not as they saw fit </s>
<s> some library boards are wary of the plan </s>
<s> a large well-stocked library surrounded in a county by smaller ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great </s>
<s> a small library may cherish its independence and established ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board </s>
<s> within a system however the autonomy of each member library is preserved </s>
<s> the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program facilities and services but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system </s>
<s> all services are given without cost to members </s>
<s> the collection may be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection </s>
<s> each system develops differently according to the area it serves but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency </s>
<s> the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends a certain number of dollars </s>
<s> this system by virtue of its variety and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation </s>
<s> the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area </s>
<s> the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford </s>
<s> the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers </s>
<s> basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries </s>
<s> the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans </s>
<s> it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide </s>
<s> the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries </s>
<s> each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters could then build upon </s>
<s> east meadow has philosophy psychology and religion </s>
<s> freeport houses social science pure science and language </s>
<s> history biography and education are centered in hempstead </s>
<s> levittown has applied science business and literature </s>
<s> while hewlett-woodmere is the repository of art music and foreign languages </s>
<s> the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service </s>
<s> this kind of cooperation is not wholly new of course </s>
<s> public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis </s>
<s> local libraries find too that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library </s>
<s> the system passes on these savings to its members </s>
<s> further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing </s>
<s> books are not the only resource of the system </s>
<s> schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs and to organizations in member communities </s>
<s> the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together </s>
<s> headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center to provide better methods of purchasing and selection </s>
<s> sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups </s>
<s> headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand beyond its boundaries </s>
<s> it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used </s>
<s> the system itself is governed by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership </s>
<s> in nassau as in other systems the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and on adult education in general </s>

<s> by limiting american strength too much to nuclear strength this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war </s>

<s> the end of trujillo </s>
<s> assassination even of a tyrant is repulsive to men of good conscience </s>
<s> but whether the murder of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered </s>
<s> trujillo knew a great deal about assassination </s>
<s> the responsibility for scores of deaths including the abduction and murder of jesus maria galindez a professor at columbia university in new york has been laid at his door </s>
<s> he had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as president romulo betancourt of venezuela </s>
<s> it was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government reportedly involving the use of dominican arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez has been uncovered and quashed </s>
<s> the recent history of the dominican republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive </s>
<s> unquestionably trujillo did some good things for his country he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably </s>
<s> but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition </s>
<s> the jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure </s>
<s> he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise and his influence extended even to congress </s>
<s> until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article of faith with trujillo and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character </s>
<s> last year after trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean the united states and many other members of the organization of american states broke diplomatic relations with him </s>
<s> thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines </s>
<s> but after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist slogans </s>
<s> what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle </s>
<s> the dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership has been suppressed </s>
<s> perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger </s>
<s> the dominican republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward western freedom </s>
<s> such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear </s>
<s> for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy and help </s>

<s> such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area </s>

<s> the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress </s>
<s> the inference has been too widely accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city </s>

<s> though walter ulbricht by grace of soviet tanks may be head man in east germany that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone </s>
<s> for some time the communists honored the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas </s>
<s> then they moved offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany </s>
<s> this is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact </s>

<s> in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr khrushchev for the third time </s>
<s> at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position </s>
<s> since laos is of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it is to washington this approach might be expected to head off mr khrushchev for the moment </s>

<s> casualties have been running about a dozen men a day </s>
<s> actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table </s>
<s> it is ironic that washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable </s>

<s> borough presidents while retaining membership in the board of estimate lose their housekeeping functions </s>
<s> some fiscal changes are important </s>

<s> but as a second-look safeguard each new project must undergo a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds </s>
<s> a road block to desirable local or borough improvements heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected </s>

<s> mr podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at loon lake </s>

<s> this year on a night cool with the front of september moving in but with plenty of summer still about the podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the pod </s>
<s> the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages </s>
<s> in the midst of it all mr podger came out on the pod porch alone </s>
<s> he had that day attended a country auction and he had come back with a prize </s>
<s> the prize was an old-fashioned woven cloth hammock complete with cross-top pillow fringed side pieces and hooks for hanging </s>
<s> mrs podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it and there it was slung in a vine-shaded corner the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow caressing movement </s>
<s> mr podger sat down in it pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow rhythmic motions and then swung his feet up into it </s>
<s> he closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him </s>
<s> suddenly one young voice rose above the others </s>
<s> here in the cool autumn-touched evening mr podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace </s>
<s> it had begun with the blue jay feather </s>
<s> walking along the lake before breakfast mr podger had seen the feather and the bird that had lost it in flight </s>
<s> the winging spread of blue had gone on calling harshly into the wood </s>
<s> the small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet </s>
<s> all day long mr podger who was a straw-hat man in the summer had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield </s>
<s> hardly </s>
<s> but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake </s>
<s> then since the auction was being held nearby he had walked to it </s>
<s> and there on the way had been the box turtle that slow self-contained world-ignoring relic of pre-history bent for reasons best known to itself on crossing the road </s>
<s> it was doing very well too having reached the center and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car </s>
<s> mr podger took no chances </s>
<s> taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it mr podger stepped into the road lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness </s>
<s> the turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon </s>
<s> but mr podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other </s>
<s> here in the cool darkness mr podger could still feel the warmth of midday could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road could still see the friendly grin on the young sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight </s>
<s> mr podger smiled </s>
<s> for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama </s>
<s> the three would never meet again but for some reason or other mr podger was sure he would always remember the incident </s>
<s> then there had been the auction itself </s>
<s> mr podger heard again </s>

<s> in each case there was an initial act of violence </s>
<s> in nashville a school was dynamited </s>
<s> in houston there were a few incidents of friction between whites and negroes none of which were serious </s>
<s> in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents </s>
<s> the nashville plan incidentally has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south </s>
<s> the program has worked well in both nashville and houston </s>
<s> it met a serious rebuff in new orleans where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents </s>
<s> another attempt will be made this year in new orleans to resume the program </s>
<s> generally throughout the south there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met </s>
<s> perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas </s>
<s> during the summer negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments </s>
<s> it was part of a citywide move toward full integration </s>
<s> so successful has been this program worked out by white and negro civic leaders that further extensions are expected in the next few months </s>
<s> hotels for example are ready to let down the bars </s>
<s> already at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis </s>
<s> several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis </s>
<s> this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago when a series of bombings was directed against negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of dallas </s>
<s> it is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the south </s>
<s> southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights </s>
<s> they insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in alabama when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots </s>
<s> all across the south there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it </s>
<s> there are many causes for this change </s>
<s> one of the most important is economic </s>

<s> i believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts </s>
<s> and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised </s>
<s> these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when where and in what manner the community shall grow </s>
<s> we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions </s>
<s> until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny </s>

<s> of course having this desire i am very interested in education </s>
<s> a few weeks ago i read in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston </s>

<s> usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page </s>
<s> on the question of admission to veterans administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service </s>
<s> it can manifest itself before discharge from service or it can come out years later </s>
<s> there is one other point we should never lose sight of many veterans who enter va hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected </s>
<s> no psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years </s>
<s> the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public </s>
<s> i believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to va hospitals </s>
<s> this matter is of great importance and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injuries for many veterans </s>
<s> some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long </s>
<s> first of all the admitting physician in the va hospital gets the patient as a new patient </s>
<s> if the doctor is conscientious he wants to study the patient </s>
<s> as a result it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient </s>
<s> secondly the va physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient </s>
<s> so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery </s>
<s> the american public must be presented with the facts concerning va hospitalization </s>
<s> the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other </s>
<s> the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital </s>
<s> it seems that open season upon veterans hospitalization is once more upon us </s>
<s> the american medical association is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer </s>
<s> we veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at va hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness </s>

<s> marketing meat </s>
<s> i am the wife of the owner of a small independent meat market </s>
<s> there is a trend to packaging meat at a central source freezing it and shipping it to outlying stores where meat cutters will not be required </s>
<s> if a customer wishes a special cut it will not be available </s>
<s> we are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged whether we want it or not </s>
<s> most women in this age of freezers shop for the entire week on week-ends when prices are lower </s>

<s> independent market owners work six days a week </s>
<s> no we are not greedy </s>
<s> but if we closed the store for a vacation we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block </s>
<s> the meat cutters union which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets </s>

<s> it was my desire to advise the membership of the legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and without an amendment to the law we could not enforce this </s>
<s> my discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises and not by innuendo criticize them </s>

<s> county college costs </s>
<s> to the editor </s>

<s> this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college and the director and two members of the board of freeholders </s>
<s> the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college </s>

<s> for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity </s>
<s> the united states and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations </s>
<s> recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations </s>
<s> i have just returned from a seven-week trip to europe and the far east </s>
<s> it is quite evident that the people of western europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war </s>
<s> the fact is that the italians french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs </s>
<s> we have no right to criticize them as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war </s>
<s> we should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into berlin </s>
<s> it would be criminal folly if the communists tried to prevent us </s>
<s> but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from granting de facto recognition to east germany </s>
<s> soviet russia has been invaded twice by german troops in a generation </s>
<s> in the last war russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated </s>
<s> probable agreement </s>
<s> the truth is that communist russia fears the resurgence of german militarism </s>
<s> berlin is merely being used by moscow as a stalking horse </s>
<s> actually the communists out of fear of a united and armed germany would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the un </s>
<s> if the communists are sincere in wanting a united neutral and disarmed germany it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age </s>
<s> it could provide security without cost of armaments and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation </s>
<s> france and other western european nations likewise fear a rearmed germany </s>
<s> if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following the example of austria </s>
<s> a united germany freed of militarism might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world </s>
<s> meeting un obligations </s>

<s> i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations </s>
<s> the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization </s>
<s> the expenses of the organization shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general assembly </s>
<s> the ussr and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget </s>
<s> but they refuse as do the arab states to support the united nations expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel and the un troops in the congo which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations but by a special budget </s>
<s> to aid international law </s>
<s> to the editor of the new york times </s>
<s> the connally amendment says that the united states rather than the court shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states in a case before the world court to which the united states is a party </s>
<s> if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic the court has no jurisdiction </s>
<s> since the connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states it also prevents us from using the court effectively </s>
<s> yet although the kennedy administration and the eisenhower administration before it have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the connally amendment as contrary to our best interests no action has yet been taken </s>
<s> we believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the eighty-seventh congress should have included repeal by the senate of the connally amendment </s>

<s> it has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing </s>
<s> however there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators </s>
<s> i have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls special long-distance calls etc </s>
<s> either it is lack of training lack of proper screening when hiring lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company which does have a government-blessed monopoly </s>

<s> expressway answer east river drive </s>
<s> to the editor of the inquirer </s>
<s> your continuing editorials concerning the schuylkill expressway are valuable </s>
<s> however several pertinent considerations deserve recognition </s>
<s> one of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea </s>
<s> we shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice </s>
<s> they start on the east side of the schuylkill have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at their destination </s>
<s> bridges tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings </s>
<s> each one of these is by its nature a focal point or a point of natural congestion </s>
<s> widen the east river drive at least one lane </s>
<s> so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems </s>
<s> paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges </s>
<s> one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent </s>
<s> this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the schuylkill expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the east river drive </s>
<s> shadow over washington square </s>

<s> starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon from city hall </s>
<s> just a preliminary measure </s>
<s> if any are left presently we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too </s>

<s> they are working on the wrong part of our anatomy </s>

<s> disputes stans column business scandal views </s>
<s> to the editor </s>
<s> the new column by maurice stans regarding business scandals is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit </s>
<s> i must in fairness take issue with his premise primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals </s>
<s> these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes </s>
<s> a sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute </s>
<s> anyone familiar with the details of the mcclellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders </s>
<s> further it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the landrum-griffin act </s>
<s> escalation unto death </s>
<s> it is being fought moreover in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories </s>
<s> they predicted escalation and escalation is what we are getting </s>
<s> some time ago however mr khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made the soviet union would make them </s>
<s> and now of course the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side </s>
<s> so escalation proceeds ad infinitum or more accurately until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds </s>
<s> the escalation must end sometime and probably quite soon </s>
<s> he feels therefore that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the united states is the least risky path our government can take </s>
<s> his proposal is opposed to that of richard nixon governor rockefeller past chairmen strauss and mccone of the atomic energy commission dr edward teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war </s>
<s> escalation is their first love and their last </s>
<s> they will be faithful unto death </s>
<s> if this capacity had not failed them they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation </s>
<s> but if his purpose was to inspire terror his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously </s>
<s> not terror but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere </s>
<s> khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps </s>
<s> when one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another it is only natural </s>
<s> thus when the russians sent up their first sputnik american chagrin was human enough and american determination to put american satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable </s>
<s> but to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly </s>
<s> the tide turns </s>

<s> whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead </s>
<s> they are leaving so fast that the president of the west german employers federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the west to volunteer for six months front-line work in factories in west berlin </s>
<s> the handwriting is on the wall </s>
<s> the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city </s>
<s> state department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary and driving two blocks into east berlin under military escort will not avail </s>

<s> so while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west were so quick to assume when mr khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat </s>
<s> shock dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions </s>

<s> dr linus pauling a nobel prize winner in chemistry has been less ambiguous whether you choose to agree with him or not </s>
<s> most of these would be in the northern hemisphere where the fallout is concentrating </s>
<s> the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn </s>
<s> but more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem </s>
<s> its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing </s>
<s> to this day the atomic energy commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout </s>
<s> of course the aec is in a bind now </s>

<s> now of course that the russians are the nuclear villains radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid when the us was testing in the atmosphere </s>

<s> after a nuclear blast one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof </s>
<s> yet if washington gets too indignant about soviet fallout it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count </s>
<s> and president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported </s>
<s> resuming atmospheric tests </s>
<s> one of the inescapable realities of the cold war is that it has thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas </s>
<s> the first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself </s>
<s> that dilemma is as much with us as ever </s>
<s> the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet tests </s>
<s> it could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations </s>
<s> it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist world domination </s>
<s> this third choice was in fact made </s>
<s> with the resumption of soviet testing and their intransigence at the geneva talks however the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken </s>
<s> once again the united states must choose </s>
<s> and once again the choices are much the same </s>
<s> only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder </s>
<s> the first choice abandoning tests entirely would not only be unpopular domestically but would surely be exploited by the russians </s>
<s> the second choice full testing has become even more risky just because the current soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere </s>
<s> the third choice negotiation presupposes as russian behavior demonstrates a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable </s>
<s> we take the position however that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us </s>
<s> it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable </s>
<s> its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice </s>
<s> one which should it fail will not have contaminated the conscience </s>
<s> that is the contamination we most fear </s>
<s> leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice </s>
<s> for that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent americans are now proposing </s>
<s> in particular governor nelson rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests </s>
<s> recent statements by the president and defense department spokesmen have to the contrary assured us that our lead is very great </s>
<s> it is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may at some point in the future be necessary and even justifiable </s>
<s> but a resumption does not seem justifiable now </s>
<s> what we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations </s>
<s> we now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake </s>
<s> this is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism </s>
<s> too often in the past russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part </s>
<s> there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what russia does </s>
<s> the refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start </s>
<s> ecumenical hopes </s>
<s> with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided christendom </s>
<s> but as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became known there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides </s>
<s> the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the church </s>
<s> as it has turned out however the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses </s>
<s> two things have happened in recent months to bring the council into perspective each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy </s>
<s> first of all it is now known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity </s>
<s> far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task the pontiff believes that a revivified church is required in order that the whole world may see catholicism in the best possible light </s>
<s> equally significant pope john has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian disunity </s>
<s> a major aim of the council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity </s>
<s> secondly a whole series of addresses and actions by the pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the church </s>
<s> the public appeal by the new vatican secretary of state cardinal cicognani for renewed efforts toward eastern and western reunion was still another remarkable act </s>
<s> noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone </s>
<s> the budget deficit </s>
<s> furthermore we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring </s>
<s> the eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received </s>
<s> the rest of the deficit is also easily understood </s>
<s> four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the eisenhhower administration quite apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere </s>
<s> four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program a responsibility similarly neglected by mr eisenhower </s>
<s> our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs are not too large but too small most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures </s>
<s> the party that won used to say something about a new frontier </s>
<s> ethics and peace </s>
<s> several effects were immediately evident </s>
<s> usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-catholic speaker or discussion leader </s>
<s> that aristotelean-thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants but in the end the concept came to reassert itself </s>
<s> speakers declared that protestants often make use of it if perhaps by some other name </s>
<s> the impression was unmistakable that whatever one may choose to call it natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence </s>
<s> another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself </s>
<s> the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable </s>
<s> but a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues </s>
<s> the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account </s>
<s> it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian imperative </s>
<s> everywhere i went in formosa i asked the same question </s>
<s> i was searching for an accent of self-delusion or even of hypocrisy </s>
<s> i never found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke though granted they were almost all members of the official family who presumably harbor official thoughts </s>
<s> their answer was it can be done and we will do it </s>
<s> he smiled </s>
<s> he smiled also at a british bloke seated next to me who asked the most asinine questions </s>
<s> that i smarted is a royal rebuff if ever there was one </s>
<s> i answered the routine question about my itinerary rather coolly </s>
<s> chiang spoke again this time at greater length </s>
<s> he says that if he were to express to you once again his own profound determination to go to the mainland and his faith that that return is feasible he would merely sound redundant </s>
<s> so you yourself must seek these objective data and come to your own conclusions </s>
<s> fair enough </s>
<s> for every person on taiwan there are sixty in mainland china </s>
<s> if the raw population figures are crucially relevant then it is idle to think of liberation as idle as to suppose that poland might liberate russia </s>
<s> the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army </s>
<s> say four million </s>
<s> it is generally conceded that the formosan air force is the best by far in asia and the army the best trained </s>
<s> the morale is very high </s>
<s> the miserable people of china the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play cannot themselves resist overtly </s>
<s> they think perforce of physical survival everything else is secondary </s>
<s> the psychological strategists in taiwan stress the great sense of family cultivated in china over thousands of years </s>
<s> it has not been extirpated by ten years of communist depersonalization </s>
<s> every soldier in the army has somewhere relatives who are close to starvation </s>
<s> the immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed a despot does not economize on his generals </s>
<s> but there are the cousins and aunts and nephews </s>
<s> their privations are almost beyond endurance </s>
<s> leninism-marxism as understood by exegete mao </s>
<s> there is little doubt if they had a secret ballot they would vote for food for their family in place of ideological purity out on the farm </s>
<s> but the disposition to rebel is most definitely there </s>
<s> but there must be a catalytic pressure </s>
<s> the military in taiwan believe that the communists have made two mistakes which together may prove fatal </s>
<s> the first was the commune program which will ensure agricultural poverty for years </s>
<s> the family is largely broken up </s>
<s> and where it is not it is left with no residue and the social meaning of this is enormous </s>
<s> for it is the family that in china has always provided social security for the indigent the sick the down-and-out members of the clan </s>
<s> now the government must do that </s>
<s> but the government is left with no reserve granary under the agricultural system it has ordained </s>
<s> thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security </s>
<s> the second mistake is tibet </s>
<s> tibet has historically served china as a buffer state </s>
<s> a friendly state sometimes only semi-independent but never hostile </s>
<s> red china is trying to do this and she is not likely ever to succeed </s>
<s> tibet is too vast the terrain is too difficult </s>
<s> tibet may bleed china as algeria is bleeding france </s>
<s> these continuing pressures social economic and military are doing much to keep china in a heightening state of tension </s>
<s> the imposition of yet another pressure a strong one from the outside might cause it to snap </s>
<s> the planners in taiwan struck me as realistic men </s>
<s> they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control </s>
<s> first and foremost they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the communist regime </s>
<s> on these they feel they can rely </s>
<s> they hope that if history vouchsafes the west another budapest we will receive the opportunity gladly </s>
<s> i remarked jocularly to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected american liberals to quemoy on an odd day </s>
<s> but our outlook has been and continues to be defensive </s>
<s> the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland is in flux and are poised to strike </s>
<s> there is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation </s>
<s> the moment of truth is the moment of crisis </s>

<s> the moment passes </s>

<s> the measure was instantly taken as always in such cases of public men at many levels </s>
<s> one knows better now who has bone and who has jelly in his spine </s>
<s> but i am here concerned more with policy than with men </s>
<s> public men come and go but great issues of policy remain </s>
<s> of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the united nations </s>
<s> but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the us was in reality the principal </s>
<s> the moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato allies to the entire western community </s>
<s> but the key revelation is not new </s>
<s> at the peaks of the nuclear test and the berlin cycles </s>
<s> in relation to laos algeria south africa </s>
<s> right now with almost cartoon emphasis in the temporally linked complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana </s>
<s> what the moments reveal </s>
<s> this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows under prevailing policy the us can take the initiative against the right but cannot take the initiative against the left </s>
<s> it makes no difference what part of the world is involved what form of regime what particular issue </s>
<s> the us cannot take the initiative against the left </s>
<s> there is even some question whether the us can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the left </s>
<s> we can attack tshombe but not gigenza </s>
<s> no matter that it is his troops who rape western women and eat western men </s>
<s> no matter that the katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of western interests in africa </s>
<s> we can force britain and france out of the suez but we cannot so much as try to force the russian tanks back from budapest </s>
<s> we can mass our fleet against the trujillos but not against the castros </s>
<s> we officially receive the anti-french moscow-allied algerian fln but we denounce the pro-europe anti-communist oas as criminal </s>
<s> the suez-hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new administration but only made more consistent and more active </s>
<s> key to the puzzles </s>
<s> most immediately relevant to these episodes in goa katanga and ghana as to the suez-hungary crisis before them is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of asia africa and latin america </s>
<s> our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes </s>
<s> if we grasp this orientation as a key our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible </s>

<s> teaching is at present a sellers market </s>
<s> as a result buyers the public must be satisfied with second-rate teachers </s>
<s> but this is not the real problem </s>
<s> the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality </s>

<s> facts in focus </s>
<s> the current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact fancy and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago </s>
<s> the public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media </s>
<s> besides there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about </s>
<s> the accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities </s>
<s> first it does not communicate </s>
<s> a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute for instance is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute </s>
<s> second it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous </s>
<s> the charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation </s>
<s> yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns </s>
<s> despite several years of front-page stories the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of mccarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating </s>
<s> the senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions </s>
<s> it seems to me the time has come for the american press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends </s>
<s> the objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors </s>
<s> southern california blackout </s>

<s> next because of the time differential the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day </s>
<s> however last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on tv were a few snatches which douglas edwards and huntley and brinkley could squeeze into their programs </s>
<s> this is no criticism of them as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary </s>

<s> for a college of propaganda </s>
<s> in my estimation we definitely do </s>
<s> and the sad part of it is that we had one which was rounding into excellent shape and we let it disintegrate and die </s>
<s> during the war we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare which included the teaching of propaganda both black and white and the various shades of grey in between </s>
<s> there were also a couple in canada and several in england </s>
<s> the english schools preceded ours and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching </s>
<s> four of us here in the united states attended first as students then as instructors almost every one of these schools in england canada and the united states </s>
<s> toward the end of the war we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it </s>
<s> when the end did come and the schools were disbanded and abandoned we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust </s>
<s> we hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so </s>
<s> alas no such thing happened </s>
<s> there apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare </s>
<s> a study at the pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there </s>
<s> and not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way </s>

<s> snow storm </s>
<s> whether in his forthcoming book c p snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important </s>
<s> one should be able to get hold of the book at once </s>
<s> but the attack was made from an advance copy </s>
<s> if this practice should take root and spread the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality </s>
<s> until the work actually appears i am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail </s>
<s> the text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt </s>
<s> the article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning </s>
<s> it submits an enthusiastic impressionistic conception of lindemann contributing another aspect of the man but on no more authoritative basis than sir charles account </s>
<s> we are left to choose between the two lindemanns </s>
<s> the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party </s>
<s> if so i would lean to sir charles conception of the man </s>
<s> i think it was a grave error to print the article at this time </s>
<s> to the unfortunate people unable to attend the godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it </s>
<s> it is not news that nathan milstein is a wizard of the violin </s>
<s> there was about that song something incandescent for this brahms was milstein at white heat </s>
<s> not the noblest performance we have heard him play or the most spacious or even the most eloquent </s>
<s> this time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood </s>
<s> but he had in walter hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point </s>
<s> that is when mr milstein thrust straight to the core of the music sparks flying bow shredding violin singing glittering and sometimes spitting mr hendl could go along </s>
<s> but mr hendl does not go straight to any point </s>
<s> he flounders and lets music sprawl </s>
<s> there was in the brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist orchestra and music to ultimate fusion </s>
<s> so we had some dazzling and memorable milstein but not great brahms </s>
<s> it got the kind of scrambled coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style </s>

<s> it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season </s>
<s> if there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans it is hard to find </s>
<s> perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics </s>
<s> anyway a number of them meet here in devastating collisions </s>
<s> one is an imperial london stockbroker called jerebohm </s>
<s> another is a wily countryman called larkin whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled i believe in earlier volumes of mr bates comedie humaine </s>
<s> well jerebohm and his wife pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities </s>
<s> they want to own a junior-grade castle or a manor house or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for great elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers </s>
<s> they are willing to settle however in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at </s>
<s> and of course larkin has just the thing they want </s>
<s> splendor by sorcery </s>
<s> the name of it is gore court and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress t s eliot </s>
<s> he conjures herds of deer and wild birds crowding the air </s>
<s> he suggests that gore court embodies all the glories of tudor splendor </s>
<s> the stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform </s>
<s> the vast dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch </s>
<s> larkin has an answer to all that </s>
<s> the spaciousness of the tudor cooking areas for example will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers cooks and maids </s>
<s> also perhaps table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented </s>
<s> for larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot </s>
<s> he has a glorious wife and many children </s>
<s> when he needs money to buy something like say the rolls-royce he keeps near his vegetable patch he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies </s>
<s> one of those capital-gains ventures in fact has saddled him with gore court </s>
<s> he is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands </s>
<s> and the jerebohms are more than willing to buy it </s>
<s> first one then the other </s>
<s> mr bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc </s>
<s> oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war </s>
<s> first the larkins are ahead then the jerebohms </s>
<s> after larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers </s>
<s> but the brigadier dines on the birds with relish </s>
<s> more than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire sancho panza in seventeenth-century spain this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character </s>
<s> nikolai cherkasov the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander nevsky and ivan the terrible performs the lanky don quixote and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man </s>
<s> his addle-brained knight-errant self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke is as cervantes no doubt intended a gaunt but gracious symbol of good moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics hypocrites and rogues </s>
<s> cherkasov does not caricature him as some actors have been inclined to do </s>
<s> he treats this deep-eyed bearded bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect </s>
<s> directed by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world </s>
<s> the complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted english language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the russian dialogue </s>
<s> the voices of all the characters including that of cherkasov have richness roughness or color to conform with the personalities </s>
<s> and the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed </s>
<s> since russian was being spoken instead of spanish there is no violation of artistry or logic here </s>
<s> it is really as though the russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons </s>
<s> but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy </s>
<s> there are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange </s>
<s> television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family </s>
<s> there seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of chicago-style jazz in prime evening time for example could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary </s>
<s> the program came out of the nbc special projects department and was slotted in the du pont show of the week series </s>
<s> perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines </s>
<s> as a matter of fact this latter approach has already been tried and with pleasing results </s>
<s> in an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods </s>
<s> the program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music </s>
<s> cameras stared at soloists faces in extreme closeups then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work </s>
<s> some of the in-person performers were jack teagarden gene krupa bud freeman pee wee russell johnny st cyr joe sullivan red allen lil armstrong blossom seeley </s>
<s> the jazz buff could hardly ask for more </s>
<s> furthermore garry moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies </s>
<s> nbc had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share </s>
<s> another source of nbc pride was its rare film clip of bix beiderbecke but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse </s>
<s> similarly in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups the program allowed no time for a close perusal </s>
<s> thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization </s>
<s> she topped the sextet brilliantly </s>
<s> miss sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene a much more girlish lucia a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing and an actress immersed in her role </s>
<s> what followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as miss sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today </s>
<s> this big flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined </s>
<s> nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene or she may warm up slowly </s>
<s> in the fullness of her vocal splendor however she could sing the famous scene magnificently </s>
<s> technically it was fascinating aurally spell-binding and dramatically quite realistic </s>
<s> many years have passed since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable </s>
<s> her debut over perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine </s>
<s> the performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor silvio varviso </s>
<s> he injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years </s>
<s> he may respect too much the italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes but to restrain them in a singers opera may be quite difficult </s>
<s> richard tucker sang edgardo in glorious voice </s>
<s> his bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction </s>
<s> the remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable </s>
<s> this features the marching songs of several nations recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand </s>
<s> all of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program </s>
<s> no reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music </s>
<s> directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time </s>
<s> but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix there is excellent depth and dimension to the music </s>
<s> you definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back </s>
<s> this is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound </s>
<s> these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record </s>
<s> in some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects </s>
<s> drums xylophones castanets and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well </s>
<s> only too often however you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right </s>
<s> they are definitely in the same room with you but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley </s>
<s> there is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies </s>
<s> all of the releases however are recorded at a gratifyingly high level with resultant masking of any surface noise </s>
<s> pass in review practically guarantees enjoyment and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system </s>
<s> many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic but not realistic </s>
<s> in any given period piece the costumes bric-a-brac vehicles and decor bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity </s>
<s> the major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter </s>
<s> the storyline in sort is wildly unrealistic </s>
<s> he talked about unauthentic storylines too </s>
<s> and to an industry that prides itself on authenticity he urged greater realism </s>
<s> he is now president of the chicago conservatory college </s>
<s> his pianist was donald jenni a faculty member at depaul university </s>
<s> he made the most of the long brahmsian phrases and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance </s>
<s> the title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer who is also a member of the national film board of canada </s>
<s> they might well indicate conjugal felicity but in musical terms that smack of hollywood </s>
<s> standard items by sarasate and saint-saens completed the program </s>
<s> miss xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control </s>
<s> and the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound </s>
<s> since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition miss xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure </s>
<s> she played with style and a touch of the grand manner and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures </s>
<s> the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers of this century </s>
<s> it was in them that miss xydis was at her best </s>
<s> the four kabalevsky preludes were also assured rich in color and songful </s>
<s> and the prokofieff seventh sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that prokofieff needs </s>
<s> so what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing </s>
<s> miss xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing </s>
<s> it only seems as if they did </s>
<s> and the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written </s>
<s> one of the very best is only now published in this country five years after its first publication in england </s>
<s> a long book heavily weighted with military technicalities in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally </s>
<s> the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is of course the field marshal himself </s>
<s> william joseph slim first viscount slim former governor general of australia was the principal british commander in the field during the burma war </s>
<s> he returned in command of an international army of gurkhas indians africans chinese and british </s>
<s> and in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war </s>
<s> on the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book </s>
<s> field marshal slim is striking in description amusing in many anecdotes </s>
<s> he praises many individuals generously </s>
<s> he himself seems to be tough tireless able and intelligent more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers </s>
<s> remaking an army to win </s>
<s> but it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command of decisions and their reasons of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action </s>
<s> before he could return to burma field marshal slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits </s>
<s> his remarks about training discipline morale leadership and command are enlightening </s>
<s> he believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many </s>
<s> he believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there </s>
<s> for general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly </s>
<s> other crucial matters required constant supervision labor and all noncombatant troops whose morale was vital too </s>
<s> health hygiene medical aid and preventive medicine </s>
<s> food and military supplies </s>
<s> logistics and transport </s>
<s> airdrops and airstrips </s>
<s> roads and river barges to be built </s>
<s> expected of a commander </s>
<s> commenting on these and other matters field marshal slim makes many frank and provocative remarks </s>
<s> it depresses them </s>
<s> field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders </s>
<s> a bunch of young buckaroos from out west who go by the name of texas boys choir loped into town hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience </s>
<s> actually the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded and they sang it beautifully </s>
<s> their singing was well-balanced clear and within obvious limitations extremely pleasing </s>
<s> but mr bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior </s>
<s> most surprising of all he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words </s>
<s> the latin for example was not only clear </s>
<s> it was even beautiful </s>
<s> furthermore there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music </s>
<s> lines came out neatly and in good balance </s>
<s> tempos were lively </s>
<s> the piano accompaniments by istvan szelenyi were stylish </s>
<s> a boy soprano named dixon boyd sang a durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly </s>
<s> other capable soloists included david clifton joseph schockler and pat thompson </s>
<s> the final group included folk songs from back home stomped out shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume </s>
<s> boys will be boys and texans will be texans </s>
<s> the combination proved quite irresistible last night </s>
<s> the polish song and dance company called mazowsze after the region of poland where it has its headquarters opened a three-week engagement at the city center last night </s>
<s> a thoroughly ingratiating company it is and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening </s>
<s> not that it is all funny by any means though some of it is definitely so but simply that the dancers are young and handsome high-spirited and communicative and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied </s>
<s> there is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title for it has a kind of nonstop format and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification </s>
<s> the material is all basically of folk origin gleaned from every section of poland </s>
<s> under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training and an equally professional sense of performing </s>
<s> since the organization was created thirteen years ago it is obvious that this is not the original company </s>
<s> it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company </s>
<s> the girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters </s>
<s> the stage is constantly full of them </s>
<s> indeed there are never fewer than eight of them on stage and that is only for the more intimate numbers </s>
<s> they can be exuberant or sentimental flirtatious or funny but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull </s>
<s> to pick out particular numbers is something of a problem but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed </s>
<s> there is for example a stunning krakowiak that closes the first act </s>
<s> there is an enchanting polonaise </s>
<s> and the dances and songs from the tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men </s>
<s> everywhere there are little touches of humor and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth </s>
<s> directed by michael murray </s>
<s> settings by william david roberts </s>
<s> the cast </s>
<s> john heffernan playing larry larkin the cartoonist carries the show in marvelous fashion </s>
<s> his portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless </s>
<s> not that mr hedison does not make the most of his role </s>
<s> he does and more </s>
<s> but the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist and it has to be that way </s>
<s> a word should be said for gary morgan a broadway youngster who as the adopted son makes life miserable for nearly everybody and larkin in particular </s>
<s> and for his playmate francis coletta of west warwick who has a bit part billy </s>
<s> on the whole audiences will like this performance </s>
<s> it is a tremendous book lively constantly moving and the matunuck cast does well by it </s>
<s> the cast </s>
<s> for the hero of this work by john osborne and anthony creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session </s>
<s> this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards </s>
<s> they not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well </s>
<s> it is into this household one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people that george dillon enters at the beginning of the play </s>
<s> an unsuccessful playwright and actor he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists </s>
<s> by the end of the third act the artist is dead but the body lingers on a shell among other shells </s>
<s> it is awfully talky for instance and not all of the talk is terribly impressive </s>
<s> but it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten </s>
<s> there is a fine second act as an example one in which samuel groom as dillon has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another </s>
<s> this is an exciting young actor to watch </s>
<s> just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is laura stuart whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch </s>
<s> miss stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment </s>
<s> also fine are sue lawless as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive harold cherry as her scratchy spouse and hildy weissman as a vegetable in human form </s>
<s> wallace gray has directed a difficult play here usually well but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste </s>
<s> still his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance despair </s>
<s> the cast </s>
<s> everybody fell in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater and shelley berman was to blame </s>
<s> in brief berman played himself and not bolger </s>
<s> the big audience started applauding even before he had finished </s>
<s> the whole production this week is fresh and lively </s>
<s> the costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the gibson girl days </s>
<s> berman whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist proved himself very much at home in musical comedy </s>
<s> sparrow-size virginia gibson with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile made a suitably perky amy while melisande congdon as the real aunt was positively monumental in the very best gibson girl manner </s>
<s> it has a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only a good comedian but an appealing person in his own right mr berman </s>
<s> the book is by jerome weidman and george abbott music by jerry bock lyrics by sheldon harnick choreography by peter gennaro scenery costumes and lighting by william and jean eckart musical direction by jack elliott and the production was directed by mr abbott </s>
<s> the cast </s>
<s> this is one of the happier events of the season </s>
<s> the company which performed the pulitzer prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce the politicians are in fine voice the chorines evoke happy memories and the little flower rides to break a lance again </s>
<s> certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking </s>
<s> then rudy bond was simply grand as ben the distraught republican party district chieftain </s>
<s> as for the ladies they were full of charm and sincerity and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving honest little man </s>
<s> charlotte fairchild was excellent as the loyal marie who became the second mrs laguardia singing and acting with remarkable conviction </s>
<s> jen nelson as thea his first wife managed to make that short role impressive </s>
<s> and little zeme north a dora with real spirit and verve was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for floyd the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings </s>
<s> all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity </s>
<s> martin tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions </s>
<s> not a corner has been visibly cut in this one </s>
<s> it has all been done in superb style and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater </s>
<s> the cast </s>
<s> the answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual </s>
<s> most of the female faces are new or at least not too familiar </s>
<s> dolores hart is charming in a leading role and quite believable </s>
<s> the only performance which was too soft for me was that of yvette mimieux but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases i suppose this was the attitude the part called for </s>
<s> i must say however that i preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it </s>
<s> to anyone who remembers newport at its less than maximum violence this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz festival ought to prove entertaining </s>
<s> the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james was never more evident than in his letters </s>
<s> here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking </s>
<s> to both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence the same gallantry of judgment </s>
<s> and how he could write </s>
<s> his letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant forthright and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor </s>
<s> to james this vision never quite came despite his appreciation of it in others </s>
<s> i think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations </s>
<s> all polemic of ours should i believe be either very broad statements of contrast or fine points treated singly and as far as possible impersonally </s>
<s> as far as the rising generation goes why not simply express ourselves positively and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other </s>
<s> the primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall is equally well known </s>
<s> thank god for that i said </s>
<s> for many readers thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight </s>
<s> the latest low is a puzzler </s>
<s> he is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties </s>
<s> the reader meets a few old friends like blimp and the tuc horse and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race her hair standing straight out </s>
<s> but there is a difference between the present volume and the early low </s>

<s> they were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the russian people fighting </s>

<s> this more than any other factor led to the fiasco of allied intervention </s>

<s> some of the new york philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow </s>
<s> a tiny handful never did make the concert </s>
<s> they faced a rather small audience as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon </s>
<s> it was an excellent concert </s>
<s> paul paray rounding out his current stint with the orchestra is a solid musician and the philharmonic plays for him </s>
<s> their collaboration in the beethoven second symphony was lucid intelligent and natural sounding </s>
<s> it was not a heavy ponderous beethoven </s>
<s> the music sang nicely sprinted evenly when necessary was properly accented and balanced </s>
<s> fortunate for the music itself it is not too frequent a visitor </s>
<s> if it were its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying </s>
<s> mr paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score </s>
<s> he did not let the strings for instance weep whine or get hysterical </s>
<s> his interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy </s>
<s> and in the prokofieff c major piano concerto with zadel skolovsky as soloist he was an admirable partner </s>
<s> he swept through the music with ease in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner </s>
<s> an impressive technician mr skolovsky has fine rhythm to boot </s>
<s> his tone is the weakest part of his equipment </s>
<s> it tends to be hard and colorless </s>
<s> a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs </s>
<s> but granted all this one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than mr skolovsky supplied </s>
<s> taken as a whole though it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra </s>
<s> mr skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received </s>
<s> this was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry </s>

<s> snow or no the fans were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance of the ponchielli work </s>
<s> so the plot creaks the sets are decaying the costumes are pre-historic the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing </s>
<s> after all the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed with no less than six leading parts </s>
<s> one of those parts is that of evil evil barnaba the spy </s>
<s> his wicked deeds were carried on by anselmo colzani who was taking the part for the first time with the company </s>
<s> he has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone </s>
<s> what was lacking was a real sense of phrase the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is after all a very oily character </s>
<s> regina resnik as laura and cesare siepi as alvise also were new to the cast but only with respect to this season </s>
<s> they have both sung these parts here before </s>
<s> laura is a good role for miss resnik and she gave it force dramatic color and passion </s>
<s> mr siepi was as always a consummate actor </s>
<s> with a few telling strokes he characterized alvise magnificently </s>
<s> part of this characterization was of course accomplished with the vocal chords </s>
<s> his singing was strong and musical </s>
<s> unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality </s>
<s> eileen farrell in the title role mignon dunn as la cieca and richard tucker as enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season and all contributed to a vigorous performance </s>
<s> if only they and fausto cleva in the pit had got together a bit more </s>
<s> the english have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else </s>
<s> the english never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way say the opera in italy blotted out the italian madrigal </s>
<s> early interest </s>
<s> latter-day interest in elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in england much ahead of similar revivals in other countries </s>
<s> as a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the english madrigal </s>
<s> naturally mr deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen william byrd thomas morley and thomas tomkins </s>
<s> there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture </s>
<s> both techniques give the music purity and clarity </s>
<s> only with the more sensual intense and baroque expressions of marenzio monteverdi and gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial </s>
<s> nevertheless the musicality accuracy and infectious charm of these performances excellently reproduced make it an attractive look-see at the period </s>
<s> the works are presented chronologically </s>
<s> texts and translations are provided </s>
<s> elegance and color </s>
<s> the elements of elegance and color in jannequin are strong french characteristics </s>
<s> baroque instrumental music in italy and germany tends to be strong lively intense controlled and quite abstract </s>
<s> in france it remained always more picturesque more dancelike more full of flavor </s>
<s> both composers turn up on new imports from france </s>
<s> bam is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is editions de la boite a musique </s>
<s> they specialize in out-of-the-way items and old french music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention </s>
<s> jean-marie leclair still is remembered a bit but bodin de beismortier corrette and mondonville are hardly household words </s>
<s> what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of french music that was moving toward the rococo </s>
<s> if couperin shows the fashionable trend the others do so all the more </s>
<s> all these records have close attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic </s>
<s> the strange delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious </s>
<s> works by j c bach anton craft joseph haydn giuseppe sammartini comenico dragonetti and j g janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including anabel brieff flutist josef marx oboist and robert conant pianist and harpsichordist </s>
<s> since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from beethoven to boulez </s>
<s> thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on saturday night </s>
<s> each might find a useful place in a varied musical program but taken together they grew quite tiresome </s>
<s> the performances were variable those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying some by soloists proving rather trying </s>
<s> they were accompanied by anna mi lee pianist </s>
<s> selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages </s>
<s> songs from china and japan were reserved exclusively for miss mao who is a native of china and those of the british isles were sung by mr fuller who is english by birth </s>
<s> this was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles </s>
<s> on the contrary miss mao and mr fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as mendelssohn dvorak canteloube copland and britten </s>
<s> there was therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise </s>
<s> the performances were assured communicative and pleasingly informal </s>
<s> the poor uneducated newlywed a certain gontran de boismassif has his problems in getting the necessary information </s>
<s> the humor of the situation can be imagined </s>
<s> it all takes place in the eighteenth century </s>
<s> what a silly artificial way of life chabrier and his librettists chuckle </s>
<s> but they wish they could bring it back </s>
<s> the musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish </s>
<s> the simple clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes </s>
<s> arlene saunders was charming as poor gontran </s>
<s> yes arlene is her name </s>
<s> the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano </s>
<s> benita valente was delightful as the young wife and john parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring </s>
<s> the work was presented as the final event in the town hall festival of music </s>
<s> had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon </s>
<s> i make this observation about the lady miss judy garland because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female reporter who flattered her terribly in london recently and then wrote in the paper the next day </s>
<s> certainly not the largest afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet </s>
<s> and judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed at times a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings </s>
<s> miss garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen </s>
<s> at the start of her program there were evidences of pique </s>
<s> her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing </s>
<s> before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music trundling microphones about the stage helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere </s>
<s> and time after time she really belted out her songs </s>
<s> to her partisan audience such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise </s>
<s> they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more as though they could never get enough </s>
<s> they were rewarded with splendid exciting singing </s>
<s> she was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers </s>
<s> in newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies </s>
<s> there was considerable contrast between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the jazz messengers who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group </s>

<s> jazz three open program </s>
<s> the evening program was opened by the jazz three a newport group consisting of steve budieshein on bass jack warner drums and don cook piano </s>
<s> this was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night when the eddie stack group also local talent went on first </s>
<s> putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot when the audience is cold restless and in flux </s>
<s> it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous newport audience </s>
<s> julie wilson sings </s>
<s> getz is a difficult musician to categorize </s>
<s> he plays his sax principally for beauty of tone rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over </s>
<s> in this he is sticking with tradition however far removed from it he may seem to be </s>
<s> shearing takes over </s>
<s> he met with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swung from jazz to latin american things like the mambo </s>
<s> shearing himself seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport appearances </s>

<s> it may be of course that mr louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation </s>
<s> but it may be also that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time </s>
<s> one thing is certain however and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be </s>
<s> but we need not mind too much because mr nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way </s>
<s> unfortunately the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so </s>
<s> nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time </s>
<s> all the performances of the evening were smooth and assured and the sizable company with mr nagrin and marion scott as its leading dancers seemed to be fine shape </s>
<s> the symphony of the air greatly assisted by van cliburn last night got its seven-concert beethoven cycle at carnegie hall off to a good start </s>

<s> they showed they were glad that carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to lincoln center of the new york philharmonic the philadelphia orchestra and the boston symphony </s>
<s> this season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the orchestral society of westchester in the county center in white plains </s>

<s> the young texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him </s>
<s> but they were not what distinguished his performance </s>
<s> the elements that did were the introspective slow movement the beautiful transition to the third movement and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final rondo </s>
<s> mr cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne </s>
<s> alfred wallenstein the conductor sensitive accompanist that he is picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding poetic mystery </s>
<s> the collaboration was remarkable as it was in both the other movements too </s>
<s> the orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively </s>
<s> and although there was plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of beethoven </s>
<s> there are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in </s>
<s> today in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show it is understandable that a song no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it </s>
<s> in the more casually constructed musicals of the nineteen twenties and nineteen thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit </s>
<s> second chance </s>
<s> like the gershwins richard rodgers and lorenz hart were loath to let a good song get away from them </s>
<s> if one of mr rodgers melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in boston or the obscurity of a broadway failure mr hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show </s>

<s> on the contrary the old plays are continually being reinterpreted and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the comedie </s>
<s> of course the well-received revivals last longer than the others and that further reminds us that the comedie is not insensitive to criticism </s>
<s> the directors of the comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the broadway producers who in two instances this season closed their plays after one performance </s>
<s> but they are aware of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full houses and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic </s>
<s> in france novel approaches to the classic french plays are frequently attempted </s>
<s> a few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent </s>
<s> among the moliere specialists of some years ago louis jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns while fernand ledoux often performing at the comedie made them more gross than moliere may have intended </s>
<s> by that time he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy </s>
<s> arnolphe it will be recalled is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be </s>
<s> the part can lend itself to serious treatment </s>
<s> accordingly at the comedie last year jean meyer played a sympathetic arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy </s>
<s> but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly </s>
<s> jouvet played him as a sincere zealot and ledoux at the comedie made him a gross buffoon or so the historians tell us </s>
<s> louis seigner who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite ledoux is the tartuffe of the present production which he himself directed </s>
<s> his tartuffe observes the golden mean </s>
<s> his red face his coarse gestures and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality </s>
<s> but his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory </s>
<s> of course they do not reflect sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation </s>
<s> occasionally seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another </s>
<s> the whole role by the way is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen seigner in his other parts </s>
<s> his normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly </s>
<s> here he is quite persuasively the very embodiment of meanness and slyness </s>
<s> seigner is the dean of the company the oldest actor in point of continuous service </s>
<s> in that function he helps to rebut another legend about the comedie </s>
<s> we are often told that the comedie has unfortunately life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage </s>

<s> he assembled quantities of facts about the nature of american politics in general as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest presidential election in american history </s>
<s> those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election </s>
<s> this is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one </s>
<s> what might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history </s>
<s> mr white who is only a competent novelist is a brilliant reporter </s>
<s> his zest for specific detail his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book </s>
<s> a lesson in politics </s>
<s> and as an introduction to american politics it is highly educational </s>
<s> the author begins this volume with a close-up of mr kennedy his family and his entourage waiting for the returns </s>
<s> then in chronological order mr white covers the primary campaigns the conventions and the presidential campaign itself </s>
<s> in the process he writes at length about many related matters the importance of race religion local tradition bosses organizations zealous volunteers and television </s>
<s> mr white is bluntly frank in his personal opinions </s>
<s> but never from mr nixon who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust </s>
<s> mr nixon he believes has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign </s>
<s> although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man mr nixon mr white believes ignored his own top-level planners wasted time and effort in the wrong regions missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television </s>
<s> he trusts only himself and his wife </s>
<s> he was above all a friend seeker almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked </s>
<s> he wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them </s>
<s> he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers </s>
<s> every decision was made quickly on sound grounds </s>
<s> efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance </s>
<s> mr kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters </s>
<s> mr white admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a democrat himself who expects mr kennedy to be a fine president </s>

<s> the better part of gallantry might be perhaps to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing </s>
<s> no orchestra however could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as miss pons encountered last night </s>
<s> in all fairness there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear flashes even of the old consummate vocalism </s>
<s> the years suddenly fell away at this point </s>
<s> on the whole however one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on </s>
<s> sharing the program was the young french-canadian tenor richard verreau making his stadium debut on this occasion </s>
<s> mr verreau began shakily with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume </s>
<s> radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener </s>
<s> lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible </s>
<s> of course the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching </s>
<s> but the growing number of negro-appeal radio stations plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects </s>
<s> these and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of sponsor magazine a trade publication for radio and tv advertisers </s>
<s> advertisers are changing their attitudes both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it </s>
<s> stations programing to negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational economic and cultural levels </s>
<s> futhermore the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects not simply serve on the air </s>
<s> it also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed that more than half of the us negroes live outside the southeastern states </s>
<s> recently wwrl won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit </s>
<s> in all big cities outside the south and even in small towns within the south radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at negro listeners </s>
<s> one question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the negro is moving into a fully integrated status </s>
<s> whatever the long-range impact of integration the owners of negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal </s>
<s> advertisers have discovered the tendency of negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests </s>
<s> and many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words working only from a fact sheet </s>
<s> sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular negro bands and singers </s>
<s> rhythm-and-blues mood music </s>
<s> furthermore news and special presentations inform the listener about groups projects and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station </s>
<s> advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special negro concern </s>
<s> the sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of j walter carroll of ksan san francisco </s>
<s> it will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the negro seeking to become urbanized as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life </s>
<s> few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived </s>
<s> few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness </s>
<s> the paintings drawings prints and illustrations all reflect the manners costumes and mores of america in the first half of the present century </s>
<s> the dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette </s>
<s> the solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of american genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes </s>
<s> in addition to the paintings are drawings prints and illustrations </s>
<s> not all the paintings however are of cities </s>
<s> the fact that sloan was an extrovert concerned primarily with what he saw adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle </s>
<s> the entire sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians </s>
<s> any musician playing beethoven here where beethoven was born is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care </s>
<s> his readings were careful without being fussy and they were authoritative without being presumptuous </s>
<s> herr riefling in everything he gave his large beethoven hall audience proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority </s>
<s> but he weighted the eighth symphony at times with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music </s>
<s> he might have been hoping to all appearances that this relatively sunny symphony in conjunction with the choral fantasy at the end of the program could amount to something like the ninth </s>
<s> but no amount of head-tossing could make it so </s>
<s> everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the fantasy for piano chorus and orchestra in c minor made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs </s>
<s> a tribe in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise </s>
<s> this theory eventually proved inexact </s>
<s> but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science </s>
<s> it is the business of cosmologists the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors </s>
<s> these keys are the working principles of physics mathematics and astronomy principles which are then extrapolated or projected to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge </s>
<s> three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator </s>
<s> dr w b bonnor reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college london </s>
<s> and dr g j whitrow reader in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology london </s>
<s> dr whitrow functioned as moderator </s>
<s> dr bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe based on the general theory of relativity </s>
<s> because of this dr bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there </s>
<s> this expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years </s>
<s> expands and contracts </s>
<s> dr bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in </s>
<s> then after many more billions of years when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again </s>
<s> professor bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory </s>
<s> he supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space </s>
<s> for this reason he says the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions </s>
<s> new galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies </s>
<s> if this is true then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence even though the universe is expanding </s>
<s> for new galaxies to be created professor bondi declares it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years </s>
<s> dr lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons </s>
<s> the charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite but dr lyttleton is not so sure </s>
<s> this would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess </s>
<s> now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere </s>
<s> dr lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it </s>
<s> this he claims would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe </s>
<s> fleeting glimpse </s>
<s> this slim book while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe has the appeal that informed conversation always has </s>
<s> several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field </s>
<s> it is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science </s>
<s> there would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions </s>
<s> in doing away with the tea tray the elephants and the giant tortoise science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos </s>
<s> and although the universe may forever defy understanding it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man </s>
<s> rather they are genuine clods proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought </s>

<s> the new york shakespeare festival which is using the wollman memorial skating rink while its theatre near the belvedere is being completed began bravely </s>
<s> the audience filled all the seats inside the wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence </s>
<s> the barbed sallies of beatrice and benedick so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult raised chuckles </s>
<s> the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verges also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers heads evoked laughter </s>
<s> at first hardly a person in the audience moved although some umbrellas were opened </s>
<s> but the rain came more heavily and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart </s>
<s> the grieving hero and her father leonato followed by the friar left the stage </s>
<s> a voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes </s>
<s> more than half the audience departed </s>
<s> some remained in the wollman enclosure fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads </s>
<s> others huddled under the trees outside the fence </s>
<s> twenty minutes after the interruption although it was still raining the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped </s>
<s> in their very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare like a nostradamus had foreseen this moment </s>
<s> the heavens refused to give up their weeping </s>
<s> but the final scenes could not be played </s>
<s> if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out let them take comfort </s>
<s> the parks department has done an admirable job of preparing the wollman rink for shakespeare </s>
<s> mr papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable </s>
<s> elisabeth schwarzkopf sang so magnificently saturday night at hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints </s>
<s> still a demurrer or two must be entered </s>
<s> schwarzkopf is of course schwarzkopf </s>
<s> for style and assurance for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her </s>
<s> if the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be it is still a beautiful instrument controlled and flexible </s>
<s> put to the service of lieder of schubert brahms strauss and wolf in a dramatical and musical way it made its effect with ease and precision </s>
<s> but what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism </s>
<s> the symptoms saturday night were unmistakable </s>
<s> clever light songs were overly coy tragic songs a little too melodramatic </s>
<s> there was an extra pause here a gasp or a sigh there here and there an extra little twist of a word or note all in the interest of effect </s>
<s> the result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness </s>
<s> there were stunning musical phrases too and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication </s>
<s> miss schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist john wustman often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition </s>
<s> all the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills </s>
<s> miss schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them </s>
<s> on saturday the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing and the order of the program improved </s>

<s> mr sansom is english bearded formidably cultivated the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between </s>
<s> the result is rather wonderful but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices </s>
<s> all are well written and are overwritten </s>
<s> but even if mr sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow he still can charm and astound </s>
<s> too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another </s>
<s> mr sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of english with a thick shower of sophisticated cultural references </s>
<s> a contemplative connoisseur </s>
<s> this is an exact description of what mr sansom does </s>
<s> he ignores guidebook facts </s>
<s> he only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions </s>
<s> it is an over-all impression mr sansom strives for an impression compounded of visual details of a savory mixture of smells of much loving attention to architecture and scenery of lights and shadows of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past </s>
<s> william sansom writes only about europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london vienna the french riviera and the norwegian fjords </s>
<s> but no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions </s>
<s> this may not be true of many writers but it certainly is true of mr sansom </s>
<s> so in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of st torpetius that still persists in st tropez </s>
<s> at the sun and the heat of mediterranean lands always much brighter and hotter to an englishman than to an american used to summers in new york or kansas city </s>
<s> and at the infinite variety of london </s>
<s> and for all his lacquered almost byzantine self-consciousness he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison </s>
<s> beauty borrowed from afar </s>
<s> in one of his best essays mr sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by andrea palladio himself that dot the environs of vicenza </s>
<s> how far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence mr sansom reminds us thus </s>
<s> nice even if a trifle gaudy </s>
<s> in recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio </s>

<s> yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do </s>
<s> we are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected </s>
<s> when the words are used we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours </s>
<s> one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit </s>
<s> just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities </s>
<s> not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true </s>
<s> demons fairies angels and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars </s>
<s> in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general which now cause us much difficulty could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously </s>
<s> the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it </s>
<s> in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit </s>
<s> the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support </s>
<s> science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time </s>
<s> when therefore it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality </s>
<s> in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions </s>
<s> there have been indeed many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful </s>
<s> all this has not however been an unmixed blessing </s>
<s> the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough </s>
<s> the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means or at best with wholly inadequate means for dealing with his experience of spirit </s>
<s> although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever </s>
<s> we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience </s>
<s> there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality as we know and apprehend it with respect to which we can refer this experience </s>

<s> as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century </s>
<s> aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene it is a quite normal community </s>
<s> the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures foibles irritations and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age </s>
<s> there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people </s>
<s> instead the audience can sit back at ease and from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion </s>
<s> a teenage girl abigail williams is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle the reverend samuel parris about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings </s>
<s> for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night the demon world is populated with real creatures and witches actually can be seen flying through the air </s>
<s> as the play unfolds however the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community </s>
<s> everyone in salem saint and sinner alike is swept up by it </s>
<s> it is like a mysterious epidemic which starting first with abigail and parris spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it </s>
<s> it grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery moral disintegration and destruction </s>
<s> the audience leaves the play under a spell it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes </s>
<s> this is not to attempt to say what spirit is but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience </s>
<s> the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them </s>
<s> we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this </s>
<s> in our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play </s>
<s> we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false </s>
<s> even mr miller himself seems uncertain on this score </s>
<s> and his belief is not to his discredit </s>
<s> apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real </s>
<s> yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over salem </s>
<s> it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power </s>
<s> it is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect </s>
<s> for this does not account for the integral elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell </s>
<s> spirit and community </s>
<s> there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit </s>
<s> apart from spirit there could be no community for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity cohesiveness and permanence </s>
<s> think for example of the spirit of the marine corps </s>
<s> surely this is a reality we all acknowledge </s>
<s> we cannot of course assign it any substance </s>
<s> yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known </s>
<s> so it is too with many other spirits which we all know the spirit of nazism or communism school spirit the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan </s>
<s> every community if it is alive has a spirit and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity </s>
<s> in searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful </s>
<s> for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit </s>
<s> it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere </s>
<s> yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community </s>
<s> the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas </s>
<s> one characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness </s>
<s> the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them </s>
<s> it is for them a given which they and they alone possess </s>
<s> the spirit of the marine corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it </s>
<s> it is they of course who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruits to find as they come into it </s>
<s> this does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching </s>
<s> his point is not that mythology may not be used but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the christian kerygma </s>
<s> when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the christian understanding of existence </s>
<s> but this statement is completely unconvincing </s>
<s> nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated </s>
<s> although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence </s>
<s> this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class </s>
<s> but it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected </s>
<s> however even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace </s>
<s> and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume as we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men </s>
<s> until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends </s>
<s> in arguing in this way we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved </s>
<s> and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction </s>
<s> but the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable </s>
<s> this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition </s>
<s> if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no or where i do not have the right to say anything at all then my only choice is to refuse to be a christian </s>
<s> this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter </s>
<s> and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is in fact marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation it is still a positive step forward </s>
<s> and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it </s>
<s> in any event it is an irreversible step and if we are at all honest with ourselves we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us </s>
<s> to say this of course is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years or at any rate since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought </s>
<s> it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong </s>
<s> what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world </s>
<s> although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity </s>
<s> they have insisted rather on living fully and completely within modern culture and so far from considering this treason to god have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him </s>
<s> when we say then that today in our situation the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement </s>
<s> for we have said in effect that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion only one is really an alternative </s>
<s> in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible we may develop this argument at greater length </s>
<s> we may show first that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by bultmann barth and buri </s>
<s> hence if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted </s>
<s> for in either event the first possibility is excluded </s>
<s> a second point requires more extended comment </s>
<s> one hundred years ago there existed in england the association for the promotion of the unity of christendom </s>
<s> but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope at least on the catholic side </s>
<s> i came to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman </s>
<s> as an american catholic of irish ancestry i came with certain preconceptions and expectations </s>
<s> since arriving here however i have formed a far different religious picture of present-day england </s>
<s> in representing part of this new picture i will be recounting some of my own personal experiences reactions and judgments </s>
<s> but my primary aim is to transcribe what englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the roman and anglican churches and about the present religious state of england </s>
<s> since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit my roman collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman catholic cleric </s>
<s> in any case i have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by englishmen even in devonshire and cornwall where anti-catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest </s>
<s> nowhere have i seen public expression of anti-catholicism </s>
<s> on my first guy fawkes day here i found catholics as well as non-catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day </s>
<s> yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population </s>
<s> she found this a marvel because as she said only six per cent of english people are churchgoers </s>
<s> she may not have been exact on this number but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten </s>
<s> from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services </s>
<s> a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university following anglican evensong at which there was a congregation of twelve he celebrated mass before more than a hundred </s>
<s> the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches </s>
<s> while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period and that religious population shifts have emptied churches a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are going to church </s>
<s> still it is clear from such reports and apparently clear from the remarks of many people that protestants are decreasing and catholics increasing </s>
<s> an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true </s>
<s> one of the ironies of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not relatively speaking many real christians to unite </s>
<s> many english catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy </s>
<s> with traditional nationalistic spirit some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism at its best </s>
<s> i have found myself saying with other foreigners here that english catholics are good catholics </s>
<s> it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the latin prayers and responses at mass </s>
<s> intercede for our separated brethren that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief shepherd the vicar of thy son </s>
<s> the english saints are widely venerated quite naturally and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs and cardinal newman will soon be canonized </s>
<s> i have not seen this charge made during my stay here but apparently it is still in the air </s>
<s> in this connection it has been observed that the increasing number of irish catholics priests and laity in england while certainly seen as good for catholicism is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic english catholics especially when these irishmen offer to remind their christian brethren of this good </s>
<s> moreover for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs </s>
<s> now not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at oxford but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non-catholic members of the university </s>
<s> some catholic priests lecture there </s>
<s> catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the cherwell with non-catholic students </s>
<s> the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant churches </s>
<s> the catholic priest though somewhat superficially drawn easily came out the best </s>
<s> there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman </s>
<s> such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-victorian england </s>
<s> there was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on bbc where comments were equally made by an anglican parson a free church minister and a catholic priest </s>
<s> catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergymen </s>
<s> a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool dr heenan and the anglican archbishop of york dr ramsey recently appointed archbishop of canterbury </s>
<s> the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in england </s>
<s> the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months </s>
<s> of course the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by dr fisher then anglican archbishop of canterbury to the vatican last december </s>
<s> english catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope </s>
<s> almost daily something is reported which feeds this catholic hope in england statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and irish catholic immigrants </s>
<s> news of a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit </s>
<s> a report that a catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters </s>
<s> the death of a man is unique and yet it is universal </s>
<s> the straight line would symbolize its uniqueness the circle its universality </s>
<s> christianity declares that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal concur </s>
<s> perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly or formulated it as precisely as irenaeus </s>
<s> to be the savior and the lord jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own </s>
<s> yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind </s>
<s> his history is his alone yet each man must recognize his own history in it </s>
<s> his death is his alone yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus </s>
<s> each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified himself with human history and human death coming as the head of a new humanity </s>
<s> not a circle then nor a straight line but a spiral represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it </s>
<s> for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence </s>
<s> as represented by a spiral history may in some sense be said to repeat itself </s>
<s> yet each historical event remains unique </s>
<s> christ is both unique and universal </s>
<s> the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam </s>
<s> as origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ </s>
<s> for god had not rained says the scripture before man was made and there was no man to till the earth </s>
<s> irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals but as universal human beings who were and are all of humanity </s>
<s> adam and eve were perfect not in the sense that they possessed perfection but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection </s>
<s> they were in fact children </s>
<s> irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul </s>
<s> therefore there is no need for him as there is for origen to identify existence itself with the fall </s>
<s> existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history </s>
<s> historical existence is a created good </s>
<s> thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster </s>
<s> the similitude of god by contrast is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature </s>
<s> recent research on irenaeus however makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction </s>
<s> he does not mean to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall </s>
<s> for he was created not exactly immortal nor yet exactly mortal but capable of immortality as well as of mortality </s>
<s> and he laid down for him certain conditions so that if he kept the command of god then he would always remain as he was that is immortal </s>
<s> these conditions man did not keep and thus he became mortal </s>
<s> yet he did not stop being human as a result </s>
<s> the true way to immortality lay through obedience but man did not believe this </s>
<s> for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin </s>
<s> and even as she having indeed a husband adam but being nevertheless as yet a virgin having become disobedient was made the cause of death both to herself and to the entire human race </s>
<s> his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin mary </s>
<s> for as it was christ the word of god who came to rescue man so it was disobedience to the word of god in the beginning that brought death into the world and all our woe </s>
<s> with this act of disobedience and not with the inception of his individual existence man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality </s>
<s> at the nadir of that circuit is death </s>
<s> and disobedience to god entails death </s>
<s> this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed namely on a friday as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday </s>
<s> he sees a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath </s>
<s> in any case though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree they obtained mortality instead </s>
<s> the wages of sin is death </s>
<s> nevertheless even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to god and he still rules </s>
<s> even death therefore has a providential as well as a punitive function </s>
<s> this idea which occurs in both tatian and cyprian fits especially well into the scheme of irenaeus theology </s>
<s> for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ </s>
<s> as man can live only by dying so it was only by his dying that christ could bring many to life </s>
<s> it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is </s>
<s> this applies to his picture of adam </s>
<s> it is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next </s>
<s> it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam who does indeed come to destroy sin but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality </s>
<s> death reminds man of his sin but it reminds him also of his transience </s>
<s> it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time </s>
<s> these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated but they dare not be confused or identified </s>
<s> the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated </s>
<s> one night so some of these theories run adam would have fallen asleep much as he fell asleep for the creation of eve </s>
<s> and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal </s>
<s> the embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change </s>
<s> on the other hand christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence </s>
<s> it is the wages of sin and its sting is the law </s>
<s> if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator </s>
<s> this seems to have been the conclusion to which origen was forced </s>
<s> if death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal ie created existence </s>
<s> such an interpretation of death radically alters the christian view of creation </s>
<s> for it teaches salvation from not salvation in time and history </s>
<s> because christianity teaches not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ </s>
<s> furthermore as an encouragement to revisionist thinking it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes </s>
<s> we today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations </s>
<s> happily for posterity then the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality </s>
<s> whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room though not out of the fellowship </s>
<s> all this near tragedy which to us borders on comedy enables us to tell the story over and over again always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency </s>
<s> parker was never excommunicated </s>
<s> to the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it </s>
<s> in both cases the stubborn fact remains liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates both legitimate offspring of its loins and when brought to the test it behaved shabbily </s>
<s> however there is a crucial difference between the two histories </s>
<s> emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside or rather by leaving it behind him he walked out of the unitarian communion so that it could lick the wound of his departure preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration </s>
<s> parker insisted upon not resigning even when the majority wanted him to depart upon daring the fellowship to throw him out </s>
<s> hence he was in his lifetime as is the memory of him afterwards a canker within the liberal sensitivity </s>
<s> he still points an accusing finger at all of us telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat </s>
<s> actually the dispute between parker and the society of his time both ecclesiastical and social was a real one a bitter one </s>
<s> it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him </s>
<s> the fact is incontestable that liberal world of unitarian boston was narrow-minded intellectually sterile smug afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened </s>
<s> parker along with garrison and charles sumner showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the mexican war and slavery </s>
<s> nevertheless we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace </s>
<s> their passions were genuine and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut </s>
<s> but parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom </s>
<s> even though his theological theses have become to us commonplaces the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us </s>
<s> there can be no doubt the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior </s>
<s> we stand more in awe of one another than most people </s>
<s> i think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons </s>
<s> an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution and only within those defined limits a license </s>
<s> by reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation we should i am sure come to a fresh realization however painful it be that the battle between parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest </s>
<s> he arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with at the least resentment </s>
<s> reproach the catholics for it </s>
<s> you and i do the same thing </s>
<s> there are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom nor a mitre on their head who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome but to the almighty dollar a pope much nearer home </s>
<s> this was war </s>
<s> parker meant business </s>

<s> so we are the more prepared to give parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy to salute his courage and to pass on happily forgetting both him and the entire episode </s>

<s> test it try it and if it works accept it as a guiding principle </s>
<s> so i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself and then tested it to see how it worked </s>
<s> the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god son of man by the virgin mary the saviour of the world </s>

<s> what a joy to realize that we too can claim this promise tendered by the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him </s>

<s> and there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world </s>
<s> the lord is the strength of my life </s>
<s> notice that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret of his faith </s>
<s> he lived in a very dark world but he was not in the dark </s>
<s> and there is light </s>
<s> the psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of christ </s>
<s> he lived in the dawn </s>
<s> he could only see the light coming over the horizon </s>
<s> we live in the bright daylight of that great event </s>
<s> for us it is a fact in history </s>
<s> he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his sins </s>
<s> if god could do that he could do anything </s>
<s> the enemies at his gate threatening to eat up his flesh were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul </s>
<s> and god had conquered that one by his grace </s>
<s> salvation </s>
<s> this is the key to the conquest of fear </s>
<s> this gets down to the heart of our problem for it reconciles us with god whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against him </s>
<s> and then with this god on our side we can face the whole world without fear </s>
<s> therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth </s>
<s> but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism </s>
<s> but as he had a special fondness for magic and divination he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared </s>
<s> after all this destruction of old literature it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu which was already semisecret anyhow </s>
<s> indeed mathematically speaking it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram </s>
<s> and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed </s>
<s> furthermore the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers by reason of its central position </s>
<s> in fact the neat balance of these pairs and their subtle equilibrium would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese </s>
<s> for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female equating the two groups with the yang and yin principles in nature </s>
<s> thus all differences were leveled and all contrasts erased in a realm of no distinction and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis </s>
<s> these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty </s>
<s> later we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally </s>
<s> this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself as though they had served as the base for all the rest </s>
<s> obviously something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives and that may have been the workings of the lo shu </s>
<s> this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking </s>
<s> scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries </s>
<s> although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers this was actually only a beginning of wonders </s>
<s> for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time </s>
<s> as such one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-han and han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu </s>
<s> but conversely one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese which they felt they saw expressed in it </s>
<s> the chinese world view during the han dynasty when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity was based in large part on the teachings of the yin-yang and five-elements school which was traditionally founded by tsou yen </s>
<s> heaven acting through the tao expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles the yin and the yang </s>
<s> the yang or male principle was the source of light heat and dynamic vitality associated with the sun </s>
<s> while the yin or female principle flourished in darkness cold and quiet inactivity and was associated with the moon </s>
<s> together these two principles influenced all things and in varying combinations they were present in everything </s>
<s> we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang while the even numbers were yin so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center </s>
<s> during the han dynasty another yin-yang conception was applied to the lo shu considering the latter as a plan of ancient china </s>
<s> taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china </s>
<s> but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps </s>
<s> the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was equated with the nine provinces </s>
<s> and whenever the lo shu involved directional symbolism it was oriented in this same fashion </s>
<s> few persons who join the church are insincere </s>
<s> they earnestly desire to do the will of god </s>
<s> when they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve christian stature it is an indictment of the church </s>
<s> a program of lay visitation evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship </s>
<s> the work of lay visitation evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have been interviewed </s>
<s> in the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to christ and the church </s>
<s> the pastor and the membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program </s>

<s> preparation for membership </s>
<s> it is important that persons desiring to unite with the church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant </s>
<s> it is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications </s>
<s> preparation for church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received </s>
<s> the pastor writes a personal letter to each individual expressing his joy over the decision assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday </s>
<s> some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors </s>
<s> it should not be postponed later than the next day </s>
<s> a helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter </s>
<s> the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference </s>
<s> if possible he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present </s>
<s> this is not a social call </s>
<s> he will discuss the significance of christian commitment the necessity of family religion and private devotions and the importance of the membership preparation sessions </s>
<s> there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel </s>

<s> a piece of devotional material such as the upper room may be left in each home </s>

<s> none should ask less </s>

<s> many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes </s>

<s> some pastors have two sessions in one evening with a refreshment period between </s>
<s> the sessions should cover four major areas a </s>
<s> b </s>
<s> c </s>
<s> d </s>
<s> following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the week </s>

<s> in this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church </s>
<s> the budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session </s>
<s> the social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members </s>
<s> additional suggestions for membership preparation </s>

<s> the following have been found effective </s>
<s> extend the number of classes </s>
<s> some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each generally held on sunday night or during the week </s>
<s> this gives greater opportunity for the learning process </s>
<s> use audio-visual aids </s>
<s> some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session </s>
<s> some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly </s>
<s> urge them to write out their questions for the box </s>
<s> use a textbook with assigned readings each week </s>
<s> select class members for reports on various phases of the study </s>
<s> conduct examinations using a true-false check sheet </s>
<s> assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized </s>
<s> invite class members to share in an extra period of bible study each week </s>
<s> ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty to the reception service </s>
<s> there is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory training including those coming by transfer of membership </s>
<s> people appreciate experiences that demand something of them </s>
<s> those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule </s>
<s> for most of them it will be their first experience in membership training since this is a recent development in many churches </s>
<s> those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed </s>
<s> the preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another </s>
<s> it provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations </s>
<s> reception into the church fellowship </s>
<s> the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church </s>
<s> this should be a high moment in their lives a never-to-be-forgotten experience </s>
<s> they should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages </s>
<s> this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation </s>
<s> it will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church </s>
<s> it can mean the difference between participation and inaction spiritual growth and decay </s>
<s> the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church </s>
<s> the atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience </s>
<s> psychologically the reception should be the climax following the sermon </s>
<s> some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register </s>
<s> provide a name card for each new member </s>
<s> outline plans for the entire service </s>
<s> arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together </s>
<s> sponsors may sit with them also </s>
<s> invite sponsors or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service </s>
<s> give each new member a certificate of membership </s>
<s> introduce each new member to the congregation asking him to face the congregation </s>
<s> lead the congregation in a response of welcome </s>
<s> have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service </s>
<s> take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board </s>
<s> have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests </s>
<s> every member of the family must have a vital place in its life </s>
<s> this is no spectator-type experience </s>
<s> everyone is to be a participant </s>
<s> very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive </s>
<s> these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership </s>
<s> this problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship </s>
<s> studies of membership trends even in some areas where population is expanding show that numbers of churches have had little net increase though many new members were received </s>
<s> something is wrong when these things happen </s>
<s> basic needs </s>
<s> new members can become participating growing members </s>
<s> but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life </s>
<s> it must be planned and carefully developed </s>
<s> the entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process </s>
<s> if the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way </s>
<s> those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest </s>
<s> however it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship </s>
<s> when they unite with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians </s>
<s> the church expects certain things of those who become members </s>
<s> the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family </s>
<s> men need unity and they need god </s>
<s> care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him but with these two qualifications the statement stands </s>
<s> the statement also points to a classic paradox the more men turn toward god who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another </s>
<s> to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones with a resultant fragmentation of the human race </s>
<s> massacres attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender </s>
<s> the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify </s>
<s> it lies in institutions </s>
<s> institutions require structure form and definition and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion </s>
<s> a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms </s>
<s> to escape this fate it must rule some things out </s>
<s> some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether </s>
<s> in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification we ought to dispense with churches </s>
<s> the suggestion is naive </s>
<s> man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being </s>
<s> having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance </s>
<s> to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools </s>
<s> both eventualities are possible logically but practically they are impossible </s>
<s> as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him </s>
<s> yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows </s>
<s> the only way that i can see is through communication </s>
<s> interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries </s>
<s> approached creatively it is a high art </s>
<s> in a certain sense interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states </s>
<s> i shall touch on three areas personal national and theological </s>
<s> by personal factors i mean those rooted in personality structure </s>
<s> some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all but by the need of men to have persons they can blame distrust denounce and even hate </s>
<s> such needs may rise to pathological proportions </s>
<s> fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us </s>
<s> to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us </s>
<s> interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all for they have no redeeming features whatsoever </s>
<s> it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they rather than pretexts for them that are causing the trouble and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies </s>
<s> while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial nationalism is more variable </s>
<s> the specific instance i have in mind is the afro-asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century </s>
<s> emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination the afro-asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires </s>
<s> as an obvious consequence obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area relations between christians and non-christians in these lands </s>
<s> colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious for christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other </s>
<s> actually however this turns out to be only part of the picture </s>
<s> nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries </s>
<s> the truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and volksgeist which these young nations very much need </s>
<s> all this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which christian missions stand </s>
<s> africans and asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda </s>
<s> the people hardest hit by this suspicion are of course christians on the mainland of china </s>
<s> but the problem extends elsewhere </s>
<s> for example in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion </s>
<s> again india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru and his followers is gone </s>
<s> the progressive closing of afro-asian ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo </s>
<s> i was seated next to the director of the seventh day adventists world radio program </s>
<s> he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them </s>
<s> after returning to the united states and raising the money he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available </s>
<s> it was not that they had been contracted for during the interval </s>
<s> they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes </s>
<s> it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-christian sentiment </s>
<s> although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and non-christians in asia the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain afro-asian religions themselves </s>
<s> the partition of india has hardly improved relations between hindus and muslims </s>
<s> neither has the establishment of the state of israel fostered harmony between muslims and jews </s>
<s> i turn finally to several theological developments </s>
<s> theocracy reconsidered </s>
<s> the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state whatever its political form </s>
<s> the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly secular </s>
<s> comparable trends can be noted elsewhere </s>
<s> the new regime in turkey is intentionally less muslim than its predecessor </s>
<s> the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months </s>
<s> now that israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions the secularists are less disposed to compromise </s>
<s> salvation reconsidered </s>
<s> my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them </s>
<s> that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed </s>
<s> i do not mean to imply that christians have adopted the liberal assumption so prevalent in hinduism that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit </s>
<s> the roman catholic church has excommunicated one of its priests father feeney for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church </s>
<s> of course in prudential calculation in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows </s>
<s> he is not talking in the main about probabilities risks and danger in general </s>
<s> he is talking about double effects of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other but causes both </s>
<s> of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended but still both are done while the evil effect is with equal consciousness on the part of the agent foreknown to be among the consequences </s>
<s> it means to do it and to know one is doing it but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends </s>
<s> naturally where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain this has to be taken into account </s>
<s> especially is this true when because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave the action is prohibited </s>
<s> presumably if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account </s>
<s> there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm </s>
<s> nevertheless according to the traditional theory a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences </s>
<s> he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action </s>
<s> above all he does not debate mere contingencies and therefore if these are possibly dreadful find himself forced into inaction </s>
<s> by contrast a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities and not with the moral nature of the action to be done </s>
<s> he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically ie by considering the worst possible outcome namely the total domination of the world by russia within a few years </s>
<s> thus moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality </s>
<s> it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself its intention and proximate effect or the thing to be done </s>
<s> several of the replies to mr toynbee without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil </s>
<s> no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature </s>
<s> but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense or a static order in which no changes will take place in time to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force </s>
<s> on their way to the heavenly city the children of god make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation </s>
<s> not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand </s>
<s> toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment </s>
<s> it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it in the past </s>
<s> this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted to the very last </s>
<s> it is to stride along the steep slope downward </s>
<s> the only contrary action in the future as in the past runs the risk of war </s>
<s> and now and in the future unlike in the past any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will by human action render this planet less habitable by the human race </s>
<s> finally just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing by human action to accelerate this end </s>

<s> here in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it </s>
<s> for a number of years wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy </s>
<s> this article presents our observations of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them </s>
<s> such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors </s>
<s> professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner </s>
<s> but as conversation goes on particularly among the realtors themselves another image emerges that of considerable power and influence in the community </s>
<s> judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers income educational level and above all racial extraction </s>
<s> a narrow professionalism </s>
<s> the rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms </s>
<s> all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white particularly negro peoples into all-white restricted areas </s>
<s> realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work as members of social and professional organizations as citizens and civic leaders as church laymen as university alumni as newspaper readers etc </s>
<s> from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding </s>
<s> there is some reality to this </s>
<s> but such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices </s>
<s> also it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed </s>
<s> like business and university groups generally these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make </s>
<s> realtors both generally and in this group have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension </s>
<s> recent studies by the commission on race and housing and others however point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion </s>
<s> there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the negroes desire for well-kept housing privacy etc </s>
<s> data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in </s>
<s> often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically </s>
<s> no one anticipates any radical shift in this situation but questions concerning reading habits the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised </s>
<s> the role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration </s>
<s> on the positive side recent federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position </s>
<s> anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and while specific provisions have varied the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage </s>
<s> there are sins of omission as well as commission </s>
<s> the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations either negative or positive plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced </s>
<s> such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry but there is little evidence that realtors or at least their associations have repudiated the principle in such clauses </s>
<s> but as yet no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods </s>
<s> one of the roles of the social scientist ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work </s>
<s> but responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional white american good </s>
<s> such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world let us say a community that embraces scarsdale or yonkers but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive </s>
<s> that community of all creation is then the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment </s>
<s> racial discrimination is wrong then not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator </s>
<s> thus moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions </s>
<s> a fragmented society </s>
<s> our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other </s>
<s> if we look about the world today we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization science and religion </s>
<s> science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom </s>
<s> religion or the lack of it will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed </s>
<s> we may feel pessimistic at the outlook </s>
<s> and yet there is a note of hope because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision </s>
<s> we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material a universe that in a word is not matter but music </s>
<s> and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith </s>
<s> atomic energy </s>
<s> to see this vision in perspective we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom </s>
<s> you know that i could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on hiroshima </s>
<s> it was only about the size of a baseball </s>
<s> that is enough tnt to fill the tower of the empire state building </s>
<s> and with the availability of bombs of that size war became a new problem </s>
<s> now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world </s>
<s> but we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb </s>
<s> hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce </s>
<s> we know that we have hydrogen in water </s>
<s> water is af and the h stands for hydrogen </s>
<s> there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies </s>
<s> i have calculated that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on hiroshima </s>
<s> and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond </s>
<s> salt water is still af the same hydrogen is there </s>
<s> and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today </s>
<s> of course there is also an optimistic side to the picture </s>
<s> for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days </s>
<s> and think if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power what a wonderful public utility company we would make </s>
<s> with just the hydrogen of our bodies we could run the world for years </s>
<s> then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come </s>
<s> it is power with which we can literally rebuild the world provide adequate housing food education abundant living for everyone everywhere </s>
<s> an octillion atoms </s>
<s> now let us see where this power comes from </s>
<s> to grasp our new view of the atom we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is </s>
<s> i have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry </s>
<s> one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms </s>
<s> i calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body </s>
<s> then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator </s>
<s> a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic </s>
<s> a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people </s>
<s> and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia </s>
<s> imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania but instead of snowing snow it snows peas </s>
<s> so we get the whole state covered with peas about four feet deep </s>
<s> you can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars </s>
<s> pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas </s>
<s> but we still have a long way to go </s>
<s> then we have sextillion peas </s>
<s> and then we have septillion </s>
<s> finally we go into the farthest reaches of the milky way </s>
<s> we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body </s>
<s> so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are </s>
<s> now although an atom is small we can still in imagination have a look at it </s>
<s> let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i swallow a magic alice in wonderland growing pill </s>
<s> i start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me </s>
<s> i shoot up through the roof into the sky past the clouds through the stratosphere out beyond the moon out among the planets until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long </s>
<s> then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across a balloon big enough to put a football field inside </s>
<s> and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom according to the physics of forty years ago you would see circulating over your head down at the sides and under your feet some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs </s>
<s> these balls are moving in great circles and ellipses and are of course the electrons the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone </s>
<s> since these electrons are moving like planets you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom </s>
<s> so you look down there and you see a tiny whirling point about the size of the head of a pin </s>
<s> this is the atomic sun the atomic nucleus </s>
<s> even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead </s>
<s> it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits </s>
<s> it also contains nearly all the mass and the atomic energy </s>
<s> and since you are made of atoms you are nothing much but empty space too </s>
<s> if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper </s>
<s> someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing </s>
<s> at any rate it shows us how immaterial we are </s>
<s> music of the spheres </s>
<s> for we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics </s>
<s> and therefore the atom was really just a little machine </s>
<s> and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts </s>
<s> so if you are made of atoms you are just a big machine </s>
<s> and since the universe is also made of atoms it is just a supermachine </s>
<s> and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe governed by the laws of cause and effect bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom </s>
<s> and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists </s>
<s> a suggestion from louis de broglie a physicist in france showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves </s>
<s> and to see the meaning of this new picture imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today </s>
<s> now as you step inside instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it </s>
<s> these ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral </s>
<s> and as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music </s>
<s> it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony </s>
<s> harmony melody counterpoint symphonic structure are there </s>
<s> and as this music ebbs and flows there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside in fact from the atoms of the entire universe </s>
<s> and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music </s>
<s> the island of nantucket part of the state of massachusetts lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother state </s>
<s> some of the island is sand and is not suitable for living </s>
<s> the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors </s>
<s> the rest is obtained from harbor scallops </s>
<s> during about three and a half months of the year in the summer there are three boats that run from the mainland to the island carrying passengers food and cars </s>
<s> but the rest of the year only one boat is needed which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to nantucket in the daytime </s>
<s> this is a fine trip too on a good day </s>
<s> even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of christianity from other factors </s>
<s> although a complete picture cannot be given we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor </s>
<s> at times we can say that it was the major factor </s>
<s> what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation </s>
<s> presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater or lesser extent </s>
<s> many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse </s>
<s> the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration </s>
<s> for still others mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration it was roman catholicism and for a small minority it was eastern orthodoxy </s>
<s> upon all of them played the intellectual social political and economic attitudes institutions and customs of the nation </s>
<s> upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was </s>
<s> yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of christianity would be impossible </s>
<s> at best only an approximation could be arrived at </s>
<s> to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd </s>
<s> for instance we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose </s>
<s> the temptation is to say that as the percentage of church members mounted the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level </s>
<s> yet this cannot be proved </s>
<s> we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed </s>
<s> thus baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness fighting malicious gossip lying cheating sexual irregularities gambling horse racing and failure to pay just debts </s>
<s> if guilty the offender might be excluded from membership </s>
<s> as church membership burgeoned such measures faded into desuetude </s>
<s> but whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know </s>
<s> what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation </s>
<s> we have already hinted at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life </s>
<s> we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards and through leaders in the government </s>
<s> throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock </s>
<s> by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour </s>
<s> in the twentieth century its influence grew as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration </s>
<s> the american dream </s>
<s> the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the older stock </s>
<s> with its zeal for liberty and its dependence on god it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the evangelical revivals </s>
<s> the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith </s>
<s> here was what was called the american dream namely the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it </s>
<s> america america god mend thy every flaw confirm thy soul in self control the liberty in law </s>
<s> o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears </s>
<s> the american dream was compounded of many strains </s>
<s> some were clearly of christian origin among them the great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian liberty christian equality and christian fraternity the passion of the land </s>
<s> some have seen revivalism and the search for christian perfection as the fountain-head of the american hope </s>
<s> here too must be placed unitarianism and less obviously from christian inspiration emerson transcendentalism and the idealism of walt whitman </s>
<s> reform movements </s>
<s> with such a dream arising at least in part from the protestant heritage of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression </s>
<s> a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills </s>
<s> significantly the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century came from men and women of new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian congregationalism </s>
<s> several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism </s>
<s> quakers some from new england had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted </s>
<s> we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the seventh day adventists christian science the american board of commissioners for foreign missions the american home missionary society the american bible society and new england theology </s>
<s> the atmosphere was one of optimism of confidence in human progress and of a determination to rid the world of its ills </s>
<s> we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills </s>
<s> a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose </s>
<s> several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century </s>
<s> others were ephemeral </s>
<s> some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose </s>
<s> still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age </s>
<s> the anti-slavery movement </s>
<s> in the latter year samuel hopkins from whom the hopkinsian strain of new england theology took its name asked the continental congress to abolish slavery </s>
<s> as we have seen methodism early took a stand against slavery </s>
<s> the nineteenth-century immigration whether protestant or roman catholic was not so much concerned for very few if any among them held slaves they were mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves </s>
<s> the anti-slavery movement took many forms </s>
<s> garrison massachusetts born of nova scotian parentage was by temperament and conviction a reformer </s>
<s> a marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the finney revivals </s>
<s> finney himself while opposed to slavery placed his chief emphasis on evangelism but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign </s>
<s> weld was the son and grandson of new england congregational ministers </s>
<s> a strong temperance advocate through the influence of a favorite teacher charles stewart another finney convert he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause </s>
<s> a group of young men influenced by him enrolled in lane theological seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position </s>
<s> the majority then went to the infant oberlin </s>
<s> he shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame </s>
<s> although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils he remained a devout christian </s>
<s> he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition but he also stood for equal rights for women for opportunity for the freedmen and for prohibition </s>
<s> individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits </s>
<s> they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer even more terrible abilities </s>
<s> their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe </s>
<s> royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power </s>
<s> thus the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors </s>
<s> but this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities </s>
<s> since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living </s>
<s> the royal ritual generated power into the other world it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world </s>
<s> proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world </s>
<s> but naturally the royal ritual which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom </s>
<s> the chinese emperor by proper observance of ritual manifested divine powers </s>
<s> he regulated the dualities of light and darkness yang and yin which are locked in eternal struggle </s>
<s> by swaying the balance between them he effected the alternation of the seasons </s>
<s> his power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions </s>
<s> in this system no man is exempt from obligations </s>
<s> and to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters </s>
<s> the family home was in fact a temple </s>
<s> and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature </s>
<s> the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear </s>
<s> the common belief was that there existed one moral order which included everything </s>
<s> the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control </s>
<s> men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code </s>
<s> if the moral code were flouted the proper balance of the universe would be upset and the disastrous result could be floods plague or famine </s>
<s> modern westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection </s>
<s> living in urban conditions away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view the individual may find it possible say to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes </s>
<s> in china the magical system par excellence was taoism </s>
<s> it was this timeless unity that was all-important and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality </s>
<s> the taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation </s>
<s> in other words they were actually an organization of magicians </s>
<s> mahayana buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts </s>
<s> after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced into china it underwent extensive changes </s>
<s> during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader </s>
<s> mahayana had gods and magic a pantheon heavens and hells and gorgeously appareled priests monks and nuns all of whom wielded power over souls in the other world </s>
<s> the self-realized mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic </s>
<s> the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic that made the world into a huge magical garden </s>
<s> nonmagical confucianism was a secular rational philosophy but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government </s>
<s> confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power </s>
<s> this was not virtue as we understand the word today and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation </s>
<s> propriety was synonymous with ritual observance the mark of a true gentleman </s>
<s> this in brief was the historical background out of which zen emerged </s>
<s> promoters of zen to the west record its ancestry and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism </s>
<s> proponents of zen to the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism in zen probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist ideas with more respectable buddhist metaphysic </s>
<s> actually zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism </s>
<s> so too was the insistence on the relativity of the external world and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure indwelling spirit the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness </s>
<s> zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience </s>
<s> one of its features attractive to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts </s>
<s> one patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse </s>
<s> but this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistakes it </s>
<s> reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge but a positive handicap </s>
<s> it is important for an understanding of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man </s>
<s> in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers </s>
<s> early chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence </s>
<s> but this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers </s>
<s> the anchorite strove in fact to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power </s>
<s> thus the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking and for this reason the mystic in asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation </s>
<s> as the zen literature reveals as soon as an early zen master attained fame in seclusion he was called out into the world to exercise his powers </s>
<s> the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles </s>
<s> exponents of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of china and proposed instead a more mature less credulous view of the universe </s>
<s> in support of this stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power </s>
<s> they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent </s>
<s> there being no bridge the master had to stop at the shore </s>
<s> but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow him </s>
<s> the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah and praised him as a true mahayanist </s>
<s> a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes </s>
<s> the american bishops assembled at the third plenary council of baltimore urged the catholic people to read the holy bible </s>
<s> the need of the new birth </s>
<s> the new birth is necessary because god is holy </s>
<s> but as the one who called you is holy be you also holy in all your behavior </s>
<s> for it is written you shall be holy because i am holy </s>
<s> holiness without which no man will see god </s>
<s> the new birth is necessary because all have sinned </s>
<s> as it is written there is not one just man </s>
<s> there is none who understands </s>
<s> there is none who seeks after god </s>
<s> all have gone astray together </s>
<s> all have sinned and have need of the glory of god </s>
<s> the new birth is necessary because the natural man is spiritually dead and blind </s>
<s> therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned </s>
<s> you also when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins </s>
<s> and if our gospel also is veiled it is veiled only to those who are perishing </s>
<s> for his workmanship we are created in christ jesus </s>

<s> the hated dictator batista had fled </s>
<s> rumors flew from lip to lip that fidel castro was on his way to havana coming from the mountains where he had fought batista for five years </s>
<s> already the city was filled with barbudos the bearded war-dirty revolutionaries carrying carbines waving to the crowds that lined the prado </s>
<s> and then castro himself did come bearded smiling </s>
<s> at first i was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man </s>
<s> i am sure that castro was happy too about that support </s>
<s> diario de la marina was the oldest and most influential paper in cuba with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny </s>
<s> my grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials </s>
<s> when it was my turn i too printed the truth as i knew it about batista and rejoiced to see his regime topple </s>
<s> none of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead </s>
<s> i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana </s>
<s> within a week however i began to suspect that something was wrong </s>
<s> for castro was bringing cuba not freedom but hatred </s>
<s> he spent long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge </s>
<s> he showed us how he dealt with his enemies he executed them before tv cameras </s>
<s> on home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon the firing wall </s>
<s> he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance </s>
<s> he had promised cheaper housing arbitrarily he cut all rents in half whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room </s>
<s> under another law hundreds of farms were seized </s>
<s> farm workers had their wages cut almost in half </s>
<s> a suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist </s>
<s> in my mind i began to review his use of hate to gain support </s>
<s> his division of society into two classes one the hero the other the villain </s>
<s> but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the palace </s>
<s> many came from communist countries </s>

<s> far from discouraging henri his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments </s>
<s> instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master montreal bodybuilding authority professor roland claude </s>
<s> jean-paul senesac whose story appeared here two issues ago </s>
<s> jack boissoneault who was with us last month </s>
<s> and a host of others </s>
<s> yesiree the professor knows his muscles </s>
<s> about that time he began reading mr america and muscle builder and he learned of the famous weider way to fast weight gaining </s>
<s> seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of quick-wate and super-protein those two wonder-working weider food supplements he decided to try them and see what they could do for him </s>
<s> well sir they did real great </s>
<s> of course he did some exercising </s>
<s> but he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body </s>
<s> and at once claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it </s>
<s> as you can see in this push-pull super set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time </s>
<s> you need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs </s>
<s> the dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the aj </s>
<s> the pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented </s>
<s> this is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved </s>
<s> as you see the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip </s>
<s> he has to </s>
<s> this gives a wide flare to the pecs causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and aj </s>
<s> this is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests </s>
<s> physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone </s>
<s> rarer still is a mr america or mr universe of true herculean build </s>
<s> now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set high-rep light-weight workouts </s>
<s> this comes not alone from high-set high-rep training but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him </s>
<s> often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others </s>
<s> only when the newest mr america or mr universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are </s>
<s> why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths </s>
<s> the facet of muscular development that wins prizes </s>
<s> definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship olympic lifters which is easily understandable </s>
<s> the one leg lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts </s>
<s> indeed a lighter weight works much better because a greater more extensive split can be performed </s>
<s> used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin </s>
<s> it places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition </s>
<s> it improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder and helps to make squats more easily and more correctly performed </s>
<s> it increases flexibility of the legs </s>
<s> it speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately thus enabling a massive concentrated effort to be focused on each </s>
<s> place your power stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean </s>
<s> place a suitably-loaded barbell across them </s>
<s> extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split </s>
<s> now raise the weight by straightening your front leg without moving your feet </s>
<s> when the front knee is straight and locked allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the power stands </s>
<s> after you have taken a breather reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear and the rear thigh now to the front and perform the same movement in the same manner </s>
<s> you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety </s>
<s> you should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise </s>
<s> squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front </s>
<s> pansies are supposed to like it cool but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun </s>
<s> i sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather </s>
<s> he seemed puzzled by my question </s>
<s> the more i talked with him the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming </s>
<s> of course his love was expressed in intelligent care </s>
<s> he planted the pansy seeds himself buying them from a pansy specialist </s>
<s> these specialists i learned have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers </s>
<s> their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains </s>
<s> i asked him if he took seeds from his own plants </s>
<s> occasionally when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did </s>
<s> i fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture tilth and body </s>
<s> nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies </s>
<s> they germinate quickly the tiny plants appearing in a week and grow along lustily </s>
<s> i like to make a seedbed right in the open though many people start them successfully in cold frames </s>
<s> if you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate </s>
<s> for my seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting </s>
<s> i dig it rake it smooth sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray </s>
<s> then i cover the sowing with a board </s>
<s> this keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds </s>
<s> ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby </s>
<s> when the first sprinkling of green appears i remove the board </s>
<s> a light porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth </s>
<s> i like sawdust for this or hay </s>
<s> every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller </s>
<s> i put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant </s>
<s> that encourages rooting and the better developed the roots the larger and more plentiful the flowers </s>
<s> pansies are gluttons </s>
<s> i doubt if it is possible to overfeed them </s>
<s> i spade lots of compost into their bed </s>
<s> lacking that decayed manure spread over the bed is fine </s>
<s> one year i simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile to which a little sand had been added and i had the most beautiful pansies in my or any of my neighbors experience </s>
<s> in addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week diluted to the color of weak tea </s>
<s> as a substitute for this organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions may be used </s>
<s> they need mulch </s>
<s> we put a light mulch over the seedlings </s>
<s> now we must use a heavy one </s>
<s> three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool </s>
<s> when winter comes be ready with additional mulch </s>
<s> i like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost </s>
<s> that keeps in the cold retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing </s>
<s> the pansies i cherished most bloomed for me in february during a particularly cold winter </s>
<s> i started the seed in a flat in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame </s>
<s> that cold frame was my morale builder </s>
<s> its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it </s>
<s> like strawberries in december pansies are far more exciting in february than in may </s>
<s> try pegging down each separate branch to the earth using a bobby pin to hold it there </s>
<s> pick the flowers keep the soil dampened and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season </s>
<s> as soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over cut it off from the mother plant </s>
<s> a second and also good practice is to shear off the tops leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch </s>
<s> these cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring </s>
<s> i like to shear half my plants at a time leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming </s>
<s> probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed </s>
<s> that done her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant </s>
<s> here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds </s>
<s> go to a reputable grower preferably a pansy specialist </s>
<s> it is no harder to raise big healthy blooming plants than weak sickly little things </s>
<s> in fact it is easier </s>
<s> but you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow </s>
<s> many people think that pansies last only a few weeks then their period of growth and bloom is over </s>
<s> that is not true </s>
<s> if the plants are cared for and protected over the winter the second year is more prolific than the first </s>
<s> remove about half the branches from each plant leaving only the strongest with the largest buds </s>
<s> the flowers will be huge </s>
<s> pansies have character </s>
<s> they stick to their principles insist upon their due but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it </s>
<s> a salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal but add an avocado and you have something really special </s>
<s> this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the united states </s>
<s> you will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted </s>
<s> it is roughly shaped like a large pear and when properly ripened its dark green skin covers a meaty melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe bartlett pear but oily </s>
<s> the flavor is neither sweet like a pear nor tart like an orange </s>
<s> it is subtle and rather bland nut-like </s>
<s> once you become an avocado fan you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation </s>
<s> naturally dormant and no spray danger </s>
<s> today refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world </s>
<s> the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree but it is still firm at this point </s>
<s> it is brought to packing houses cleaned and graded as to size and quality and packed in protective excelsior </s>
<s> one of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind </s>
<s> there is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed </s>
<s> if the temperature is controlled properly the avocado will delay its ripening until needed </s>
<s> and unlike other fruits one cannot eat the skin of the avocado </s>
<s> nutritious and a cholesterol reducer </s>
<s> good taste and versatility plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit even if its nutritional values were limited </s>
<s> avocados however are very rich in nutrients </s>
<s> their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system </s>
<s> the b vitamins are well represented especially thiamin and riboflavin </s>
<s> calcium phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts </s>
<s> none of these values is destroyed not significantly altered by refrigeration storage </s>
<s> dr wilson c grant of the veterans administration hospital coral gables florida and the university of miami school of medicine set out to discover if avocados because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients </s>
<s> they were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible the normal cholesterol level of their blood </s>

<s> the tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard </s>
<s> the pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach </s>
<s> never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear </s>
<s> nuclear weapons are fearsome but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying </s>
<s> a great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets </s>
<s> the nation would be utterly devastated </s>
<s> the will of its people so crucial in time of peril would be broken </s>
<s> nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days </s>
<s> and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes </s>
<s> it should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic </s>
<s> icbms have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways </s>
<s> if our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles </s>
<s> we must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves </s>
<s> we must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile </s>
<s> missiles are very valuable weapons but they also have their too little known limitations </s>
<s> one must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target decide that it is worthy of destruction select the missile to be fired against the target compute ballistics for the flight and prepare the missile for firing </s>
<s> until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us </s>
<s> let us suppose the russians decide to build a rail-mobile icbm force </s>
<s> the aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile fleeting and imprecisely located targets as well as the known fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile </s>
<s> war under these circumstances cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation </s>
<s> forces will survive a surprise attack and these forces will give depth or considerable duration to the conflict </s>
<s> the forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed </s>
<s> even mobile forces must be found and destroyed </s>
<s> they are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile </s>
<s> some day many years in the future true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets </s>
<s> but until we have an effective spacecraft the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft </s>
<s> nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease </s>
<s> here then is our problem aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing </s>
<s> but the airfield on which the aircraft is completely dependent is doomed by the missile </s>
<s> aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once </s>
<s> this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile </s>
<s> eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles </s>
<s> there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground </s>
<s> use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life </s>
<s> we could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters </s>
<s> there is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile </s>
<s> this same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft </s>
<s> with powerplants such as these vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built </s>
<s> when aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields they are no longer vulnerable to aj </s>
<s> if our sac bombers were today capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at russia again and again and again those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance </s>
<s> with such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating </s>
<s> our first necessity at the very outset of war is post-attack reconnaissance </s>
<s> a ballistic missile cannot today tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful </s>
<s> these crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance </s>
<s> pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably </s>
<s> it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance </s>
<s> it could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night </s>
<s> it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons </s>
<s> today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings runways taxi-ways separate spans of bridges etc </s>
<s> but for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers the work presents its problems </s>
<s> moreover the piece is written in five movements rather than the conventional four of most quintets and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor </s>
<s> the many and frequent performances of the trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing </s>
<s> some renditions are of symphonic dimensions with the contrabass given free rein </s>
<s> other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation </s>
<s> recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer than ten different performances </s>
<s> let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first </s>
<s> artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert-beethoven-mozart players of all time and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable </s>
<s> yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master and as a result the playing here has humor delicacy and radiant humanity </s>
<s> this is a serious-minded interpretation but it is never strait-laced </s>
<s> the piano performance on this trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives </s>
<s> from a technical standpoint the string playing is good but the pro arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here </s>
<s> the violinist in particular is very indulgent with swoops and slides and his tone is pinched and edgy </s>
<s> the twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet </s>
<s> the assisting musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in expertise but their contribution is rustic and appealing </s>
<s> it is moreover a perfectly integrated ensemble effort </s>
<s> helmut roloff playing with a group of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble gives a sturdy reading in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists </s>
<s> from the beginning of commercial recording new discs purported to be indistinguishable from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation </s>
<s> seen in perspective many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones </s>
<s> although lacking absolute verisimilitude they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original </s>
<s> since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold </s>
<s> in many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer </s>
<s> other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics </s>
<s> if we return to them today we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing </s>
<s> records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music </s>
<s> this difference is made up of many factors </s>
<s> some of them are obvious such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings </s>
<s> any alteration of one of these factors is distortion although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests </s>
<s> yet it is the accumulation of distortion the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness that makes records sound like records </s>
<s> the sound may be good </s>
<s> but if you know the real thing you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation </s>
<s> because of this only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers triumph </s>
<s> the easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values </s>
<s> the engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness </s>
<s> the effect of the recording is very open and natural with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance </s>
<s> this absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity but it eliminates listener fatigue </s>
<s> a contributing factor is the perspective the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained </s>
<s> the orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes valve clicks and other noises incidental to playing </s>
<s> yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall </s>
<s> command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation </s>
<s> the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority </s>
<s> yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer </s>
<s> the timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance </s>
<s> all of this would be wasted of course if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction </s>
<s> for me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors </s>
<s> steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score discounting tradition and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what brahms set down on paper </s>
<s> those accustomed to broader more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one </s>
<s> without losing the distinctive undertow of brahmsian rhythm the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect </s>
<s> the presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you as the real allegro con spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet </s>
<s> in the end however the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings </s>
<s> steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song </s>
<s> the engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result </s>
<s> too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment </s>

<s> the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle but once understood the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement </s>
<s> in the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves </s>
<s> if the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time </s>
<s> close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars </s>
<s> these can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets </s>
<s> the number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented </s>
<s> two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar </s>
<s> these slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved locking and unlocking them </s>
<s> this also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side thus moving one or more locking bars </s>
<s> the dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets </s>
<s> by this scheme pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal </s>
<s> there are other basic rules </s>
<s> a turnout may have two levers one to actually move the switch points the other to lock the points </s>
<s> a signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked </s>
<s> the lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point </s>
<s> the lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars </s>
<s> in some low-speed situations the distant signal is fixed at caution </s>
<s> in other instances where there is no automatic block signaling the distant has only green and yellow aspects </s>

<s> frame </s>
<s> you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish </s>
<s> our instructions assume you are building this particular frame which is for a junction </s>
<s> when cutting the pieces dress the ends smooth and square with a smooth file or sanding disk </s>
<s> these will be drilled and tapped later on </s>
<s> solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame </s>
<s> cap with a af bar and tack-solder in place </s>
<s> remove all the loose spacing bars </s>
<s> mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together </s>
<s> either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions </s>
<s> dress all surfaces with a file cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs </s>
<s> now reassemble the frame using af roundhead steel screws and nuts </s>
<s> number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots </s>
<s> remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth </s>
<s> these are supporting members for the short locking bars </s>
<s> cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut </s>
<s> tappets and locking bars </s>
<s> to find the other stop screw position insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge </s>
<s> repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars </s>
<s> these will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts </s>
<s> fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times </s>
<s> as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible </s>
<s> a little extra work here will pay off with a smooth snug-fitting machine when you are finished </s>
<s> each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting </s>
<s> the order of fitting is not too important </s>
<s> however we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back </s>
<s> since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout we will only describe the construction of one locking bar </s>
<s> all the bars are cut from af brass </s>
<s> draw-file the edges square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame </s>

<s> scribe v-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool </s>
<s> we used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about </s>
<s> such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts </s>
<s> file to a smooth finish </s>
<s> a barrette swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one </s>
<s> endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible </s>
<s> the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it </s>
<s> assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces </s>

<s> scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics </s>
<s> math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are therefore essential to any scientific endeavor </s>
<s> hot rodding is a science </s>
<s> a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems </s>
<s> however he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding </s>
<s> a mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem </s>
<s> it places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed </s>
<s> the first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula </s>
<s> the equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem </s>
<s> equations for rodding formulas are not complicated </s>
<s> they involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes </s>
<s> however it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order </s>
<s> they indicate simple division multiplication subtraction and addition </s>
<s> the symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other </s>
<s> the lower number is always divided into the upper number af </s>
<s> it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row </s>
<s> for example af </s>
<s> numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order </s>
<s> the result will be the same regardless of the order used </s>
<s> the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign </s>
<s> this is nothing more than a dash </s>
<s> it separates two or more numbers </s>
<s> the number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol </s>
<s> for example af </s>
<s> when more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct </s>
<s> the symbol is used to separate two or more numbers </s>
<s> for example af </s>
<s> numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order </s>
<s> when solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value </s>
<s> multiplication subtraction and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right </s>
<s> completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication subtraction or addition steps af </s>
<s> for use in formulas fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents </s>
<s> the easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart </s>
<s> charts for this purpose are available from many sources </s>
<s> they are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments </s>
<s> the various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places </s>
<s> shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result </s>
<s> a constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation </s>
<s> it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly </s>
<s> rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport </s>
<s> the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and quite often are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events </s>
<s> when it is needed one formula is as important as another </s>
<s> however some formulas are used more than others </s>
<s> engine displacement </s>
<s> a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine </s>
<s> most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions </s>
<s> it is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed </s>
<s> pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles </s>
<s> actually the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine </s>
<s> the cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders </s>
<s> the formula is af </s>
<s> dimensions in inches and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches </s>
<s> the formula with the fractions converted to decimals becomes af </s>
<s> to arrive at the answer multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right </s>
<s> the different steps will look like this af </s>
<s> compression ratio </s>
<s> cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid </s>
<s> cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula af </s>
<s> to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level </s>
<s> then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface </s>
<s> do not overfill the chamber </s>
<s> this is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension </s>
<s> such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber </s>
<s> the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity </s>
<s> however the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters </s>
<s> the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used </s>
<s> the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms </s>
<s> the volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume </s>
<s> another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position </s>
<s> compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth </s>
<s> the formula for this step is af </s>
<s> this volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening </s>
<s> after the factors just described have been computed they are applied to the following formula af </s>
<s> applying these figures to the formula we get the equation af </s>
<s> this method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads </s>
<s> any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible with normal means to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed </s>
<s> the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position </s>
<s> there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed engine speed rear axle gear ratio and rear tire size </s>
<s> by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three </s>
<s> to simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors </s>
<s> these are </s>
<s> mph for car speed </s>
<s> for engine crankshaft speed </s>
<s> for rear axle gear ratio </s>
<s> for tire size </s>
<s> tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly </s>
<s> this is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft </s>
<s> a tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made </s>
<s> the measurement must be in inches </s>
<s> any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics </s>
<s> to determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed gear ratio and tire size the formula is af </s>
<s> to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is af </s>
<s> using the same figures as for the previous example the equation becomes af </s>

<s> the southward route was the classic run in california and the most fashionable </s>
<s> breakfast was at the palace hotel luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest and dinner was either at boulder creek or at santa cruz </s>
<s> gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring so halts were contrived between meals </s>
<s> then the chinese hostler who rode with vernon on the box would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon sandwiches pickled eggs and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp </s>
<s> in spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine </s>
<s> they gathered roots bulbs odd ferns leaves and bits of resin from the rare santa lucia fir which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains </s>
<s> in the spanish days franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense </s>
<s> it yields a fragrance as orphic as that of the pastilles of malabar </s>
<s> vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks and he was glad when the trips dropped off and the botanists began to motor out by themselves </s>
<s> my friend often breakfasted with vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run </s>
<s> this was an honor like dining with a captain at his private table </s>
<s> the hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove </s>
<s> it was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters </s>
<s> its early morning patrons were coachmen who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy </s>

<s> the horses were groomed to a high gloss </s>
<s> departing they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw for they had been trained to drag at important funerals </s>

<s> sherry remained in his hotel suite where he amused himself as best he could </s>
<s> it was a post of honor held inviolate for him </s>
<s> he had the primacy among the coachmen </s>
<s> of majestic build rubicund and slash-mouthed he resembled the late general winfield scott who was said to be the most imposing general of his century if not of all centuries </s>
<s> vernon wore a gray tall hat a gardenia and maroon wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly </s>
<s> promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho </s>
<s> he had style he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked epsom surtout and when the horses leaned at a curve as if bent by the force of a gale he leaned with them </s>
<s> they cantered down the peninsula not slackening until the coach reached woodside where the santa cruz uplands begin </s>
<s> inns have burned down moved elsewhere or taken other names </s>
<s> an agreeable ease suffused vernon and the passengers of the tallyho from which there issued clouds of smoke </s>
<s> vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard indulging in a huge cigar </s>
<s> the horses moved at a clump </s>
<s> they were no more on parade than was their driver </s>
<s> one fork of the road was as good as another </s>
<s> the santa cruz mountains sprawl over three counties and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain even when heat bakes the santa clara valley below at the left </s>

<s> dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets </s>

<s> menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view </s>
<s> the gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit </s>
<s> all are well distributed not crowded together near the stern </s>
<s> nor is she a wet boat </s>
<s> a lot of thought went into storage space construction </s>
<s> the cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis life jackets etc </s>
<s> the aft cockpit has a af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat </s>
<s> therefore the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens etc on a table saw </s>
<s> construction follows a thorough study of the drawings </s>
<s> start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor </s>
<s> draw each outline in a different-color chalk one on top of the other </s>
<s> in this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes </s>
<s> after notching it for the keelson chines and battens the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails </s>
<s> the frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines </s>
<s> if notched for the battens they would require more work be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through </s>
<s> nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking </s>
<s> the jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete </s>
<s> this is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction </s>
<s> be sure all members are parallel vertical and level as required </s>
<s> the frames are glued and screwed to this piece </s>
<s> the joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated fiberglas cloth and nailed </s>
<s> it is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced </s>
<s> the keelson made of two three-inch widths is next installed </s>
<s> the first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two </s>
<s> the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first </s>
<s> note however that it is six inches shorter at the forward end </s>
<s> a stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one </s>
<s> the stem is laminated from four pieces </s>
<s> take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four </s>
<s> then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig </s>
<s> the first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames </s>
<s> the second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member </s>
<s> a number of c clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets </s>
<s> all bottom battens are two inches wide </s>
<s> the side ones are a half-inch narrower </s>
<s> the battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames </s>
<s> placement is important because the rear seat bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens </s>
<s> with the exception of two battens all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling </s>
<s> the chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending </s>
<s> fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple jig </s>
<s> the aluminum flush against the battens acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily </s>
<s> four pieces are used </s>
<s> another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening </s>
<s> the best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off </s>
<s> then trim the excess </s>
<s> i used a homemaster routo-jig made by porter cable for this job </s>
<s> when cut the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming </s>
<s> then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom frames keelson and all the battens </s>
<s> it may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings </s>
<s> the next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points </s>
<s> then it is replaced and fastened </s>
<s> the bottom planking is applied in the same manner </s>
<s> after planking the bottom gets a layer of fiberglas </s>
<s> the spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws </s>
<s> then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation </s>
<s> since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails they are also rough-sanded in that area </s>
<s> the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time </s>
<s> lay the cloth in place and trim it to size </s>
<s> then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin </s>
<s> when the resin has hardened mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish </s>
<s> i used bright red mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener </s>
<s> using a cheap brush coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth </s>
<s> when the cloth is smooth apply another coat of resin spreading it with a paint roller </s>
<s> be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden </s>
<s> when the whole bottom has hardened use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail </s>
<s> then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem </s>
<s> before the resin has hardened screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline </s>
<s> this protects the bottom in beaching </s>
<s> they will also supply literature on application </s>
<s> i set it on the gator trailer </s>
<s> i laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem also installing a bow eye at this time </s>
<s> for added strength i also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint </s>
<s> again these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed </s>
<s> after trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height the top of the side planking is installed </s>
<s> this is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom </s>
<s> these flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry </s>
<s> the sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom forming a real strong transom brace </s>
<s> note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces </s>
<s> the decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood </s>
<s> all the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood </s>
<s> most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring </s>
<s> the exception is where the flooring butts </s>
<s> these battens are glued and screwed to the frames </s>
<s> with all deck battens in place the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line </s>
<s> use one coat of firzite and one coat of marine paint </s>
<s> bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place </s>
<s> after the decking is on the cabin sides are installed </s>
<s> the windshield glass is shatterproof and plexiglas is used in the cabin </s>
<s> inside bunks are framed up and installed as indicated </s>
<s> a head is a handy thing to have and i installed one under a removable section of the port bunk </s>
<s> the sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink </s>
<s> for padding the seats and bunks i used ensolite type aj </s>
<s> lightweight non-absorbent fire resistant and dimensionally stable it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement </s>
<s> available in af sheets it costs about a dollar a square foot </s>
<s> you can build this vacation cottage yourself </s>
<s> because of the unique design by the architect egils hermanovski you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time </s>
<s> most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials and requires the use of only simple tools </s>
<s> on the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim </s>
<s> in recognition of the growing trend for second homes or vacation cottages we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind </s>
<s> it is a big project not to be taken lightly </s>
<s> but each step has been broken down into easy stages utilizing standard materials and simple tools well within the capabilities of the handyman </s>
<s> the theory </s>
<s> the idea behind our design is modular units or panelization </s>
<s> everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials </s>
<s> wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors making for a minimum of cutting </s>
<s> we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop panel by panel according to plan </s>
<s> thus when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend </s>
<s> the roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days </s>
<s> then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure </s>
<s> a warning </s>
<s> due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country the first thing to do is to find out what if any they are </s>
<s> close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used </s>
<s> in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all </s>
<s> this can usually be found out at the nearest town hall </s>
<s> at the same time check the electrical plumbing and sanitary requirements as well as possible zoning regulations </s>
<s> be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion </s>
<s> if there are any major restrictions they usually can be obtained in printed form </s>
<s> where a building permit is required find out what you must present when applying for one </s>
<s> in many cases you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector </s>
<s> these will be available at cost from our plans department </s>
<s> the site </s>
<s> is there evidence of wash-outs on the property </s>
<s> a visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative </s>
<s> note where the sun rises and sets and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from </s>
<s> we will take up alternative foundations later on </s>
<s> the materials </s>
<s> this will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost </s>
<s> bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions fancy flooring appliances and fixtures electrical wiring and plumbing all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues </s>
<s> the wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard af and af of a good grade free from structural faults </s>
<s> they should be as straight as possible as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected </s>
<s> the outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood plastic coated panel board high density particle board asbestos-cement board or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer </s>
<s> the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired </s>
<s> all panel board comes in standard af foot size </s>
<s> it is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame </s>
<s> the louvers are constructed as shown in the detail with a drop door for ventilation </s>
<s> there are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them </s>
<s> the door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade </s>
<s> the filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full af sheets as shown leaving no wastage </s>
<s> the battens covering the joints are of af stock and are applied after the walls are erected </s>
<s> all nails should be rustproof and aluminum is highly recommended </s>
<s> other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim </s>
<s> in any case there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels </s>
<s> with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools fixtures and attachments available the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool </s>
<s> there is often a means of locking the quill and on larger presses the table can be tilted </s>
<s> the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work </s>
<s> set-up and maintenance </s>
<s> the drill press should be leveled and depending on whether it is a bench or floor model bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws </s>
<s> this will reduce vibration and increase accuracy </s>
<s> a coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table </s>
<s> wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill </s>
<s> presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill </s>
<s> the rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush </s>
<s> be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease </s>
<s> belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount </s>
<s> excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings </s>
<s> most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position </s>
<s> turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension counter-clockwise will increase it </s>
<s> some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key </s>
<s> feeds and speeds </s>
<s> drill speeds are important if you want a good job </s>
<s> each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed depending on the material worked </s>
<s> on most drill presses it is impossible to get the exact speed but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys </s>
<s> you will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool </s>
<s> generally the larger the tool and the harder the material the slower the speed </s>
<s> feed pressure is also of major importance </s>
<s> too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools </s>
<s> too light a feed particularly with metal or other hard material causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge </s>
<s> the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate </s>
<s> common drilling tools </s>
<s> there are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes </s>
<s> the most common are the twist drill the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades the double spur bit and the power wood bit </s>
<s> the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade </s>
<s> since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced they should be used at the slowest speed available and fed very slowly to avoid binding </s>
<s> fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool so if you want to avoid nicked fingers keep your hands well out of the way </s>
<s> simple hole drilling operations </s>
<s> when drilling all the way through a workpiece always place a piece of scrap wood underneath </s>
<s> this will not only protect the work table but also assure a clean breakthrough </s>
<s> another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through then drill half way with the dimensional bit turn the piece over and finish from the other side </s>
<s> in soft woods with pronounced grain there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander due to the varying hardness of the wood </s>
<s> in this case drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy </s>
<s> when a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth mark the depth on the side of the stock then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark </s>
<s> the depth gauge rod can now be set and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth </s>
<s> the old-time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects </s>
<s> for their length their types of construction their picturesque settings and their literary associations they should be known and remembered </s>
<s> in this sequence i shall write about them in the order of their erection </s>
<s> this paper was signed by forty-five persons subscribing a total of two hundred shares </s>
<s> a month later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that the bridge was to be built </s>
<s> he says of it </s>
<s> the division between the island and this shore consists principally of an arch </s>
<s> in appearance and construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge </s>
<s> the whole length of essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four </s>
<s> i have already mentioned that mr timothy palmer of newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country </s>
<s> as mr palmer was educated to house-building only and had never seen a structure of this nature </s>
<s> that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was sixteen years old </s>
<s> and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect moody spofford </s>
<s> it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth haverhill and philadelphia </s>
<s> the essex merrimack bridge when first built was not covered </s>
<s> it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter who was one of the first share-holders stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion </s>
<s> and although he later explained that he was talking french it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening </s>
<s> the north portion of the essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning </s>
<s> the southern half however on account of its underbracing was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation </s>
<s> this was built by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette county pennsylvania </s>
<s> timothy palmer had general supervision of the work </s>
<s> information is hereby given that mr timothy palmer of newburyport mass has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the chain bridge in the states of massachusetts new hampshire vermont rhode island and connecticut so far as relates to the sale of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges </s>
<s> john templeman </s>
<s> this chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end </s>
<s> the horse and men were saved but the oxen drowned </s>
<s> the bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements war fire and floods as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic for more than a hundred years </s>
<s> twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister </s>
<s> it is one of the very few if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the us highway system thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days </s>
<s> so frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known structures in west virginia </s>
<s> the chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders and against the competition of other and better known bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike a dozen years before as well as many other bridges for several counties </s>
<s> during the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior </s>
<s> union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams </s>
<s> general jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings including the long bridge at fairmont and after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it </s>
<s> reverend joshual corder a baptist minister gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure </s>
<s> he reasoned and argued pointing out that jones or other confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat </s>
<s> on the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose </s>
<s> we have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy </s>
<s> we have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds </s>
<s> true our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools thereby diluting our spectacular attractions </s>
<s> but problems cling to pools as any pool owner knows </s>
<s> where to put it </s>
<s> we speak from varying viewpoints </s>
<s> one of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house </s>
<s> the other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill </s>
<s> if you are dreaming of a blue shimmering pool right outside your living room windows close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children damp towels squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys </s>
<s> you are likely to be nearer the truth </s>
<s> on the other hand out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool </s>
<s> another dilemma as picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool </s>
<s> yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed </s>
<s> as in choosing a wife it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good </s>
<s> in the colder climes for instance you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best </s>
<s> it may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay or an ice floe studded with logs </s>
<s> even a neat plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold </s>
<s> probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts </s>
<s> naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land </s>
<s> but if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house </s>
<s> and a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods but good hard pavement </s>
<s> but not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies </s>
<s> we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards </s>
<s> our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled </s>
<s> not at all </s>
<s> we had merely been discovered by the pool sharks </s>
<s> we were in business </s>
<s> our book of etiquette </s>
<s> so rules we made in unabashed collusion </s>
<s> since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners </s>
<s> just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view </s>
<s> their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool but on our terms and at our times </s>
<s> no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand </s>
<s> no young children may come without adults except for a specific organized chaperoned party </s>
<s> and accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities </s>
<s> a gaggle of gabbling mothers backs to the pool is no safeguard </s>
<s> we designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours </s>
<s> we also worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille </s>
<s> we gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides </s>
<s> life-preservers the buckle-on kapok-filled kind are held in readiness too for the very young </s>
<s> preserving life and limb </s>
<s> safety rules of course are more important than all the others put together </s>
<s> but fenced or unfenced no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay </s>
<s> we allow no underwater endurance contests either or inexpert versions of water polo </s>
<s> and divers must be enjoined to look before they leap either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge </s>
<s> all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups </s>
<s> you should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits </s>
<s> soignee pools alas do not just happen </s>
<s> they are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements </s>
<s> or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers </s>
<s> even so every pool owner in case of emergency should have some idea of what makes things work </s>
<s> a brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis </s>
<s> preserving the pool </s>
<s> a sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight </s>
<s> you need more chlorine </s>
<s> the walls feel slippery </s>
<s> you need algaecide </s>
<s> with or without professional help you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse </s>
<s> you should see to it that the trap the dirt-catcher in front of the filter is always clean </s>
<s> a pool is no place for a shut trap </s>
<s> you should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water </s>
<s> when shed they leave rust marks </s>
<s> you can hope against hope that come spring cleaning your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing </s>
<s> it has happened </s>
<s> many hours of spring cleaning will be saved however if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall </s>
<s> as the pool is emptied stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet </s>
<s> much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp but requires dynamite if allowed to dry </s>
<s> do not forget this possibility </s>
<s> if your pool is located on or near sloping ground it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris </s>
<s> it may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around </s>
<s> once on the water these little visitors seldom leave and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present </s>
<s> often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense </s>
<s> our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible from pipes to brushes </s>
<s> you may find yourself hitting bottom literally as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in </s>
<s> draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania </s>
<s> fortunately it is the fha which has arrived at this conclusion for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress </s>
<s> even if you live above that line the fha will back you for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged </s>
<s> two men can often do the installation in a day </s>
<s> no less an authority than the fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs </s>
<s> home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted </s>
<s> we know too that health is never harmed by summer cooling </s>
<s> on the contrary there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills </s>
<s> the filtered air benefits allergies asthma sinus hay fever </s>
<s> control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid </s>
<s> heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat </s>
<s> housekeeping is easier </s>
<s> the cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum fewer trips to the dry cleaners lighter loads for the washing machine </s>
<s> the need for reupholstering redecorating repainting becomes more infrequent </s>
<s> clothes hold their shape better and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words </s>
<s> it will improve your disposition </s>
<s> the children can have their daytime naps and hot meals and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms </s>
<s> you can forget about screens and leave the storm windows up all year around </s>
<s> best of all central air conditioning is something you can afford </s>
<s> that brings its per-year cost down mighty low </s>
<s> for any house </s>
<s> no matter what style your home is ranch two-story colonial or contemporary central air conditioning is easily installed </s>
<s> it can go in out-of-the-way waste space </s>
<s> manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial </s>
<s> if your house is to have a forced warm air system cooling can be a part of it </s>
<s> this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system for your regular heating ductwork filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling </s>
<s> the units can be installed in basement attic crawlspace or in a closet located in the living area </s>
<s> from the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard garage carport or basement </s>
<s> if you plan to add cooling later to your heating system there are things to watch for </s>
<s> be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed </s>
<s> they may be inaccessible later </s>
<s> be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling </s>
<s> this is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone </s>
<s> be sure you get a perimeter heating system and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating </s>
<s> you can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house </s>
<s> for cooling chilled water is circulated instead of hot water </s>
<s> separate systems </s>
<s> if the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system </s>
<s> the simplest kind of separate system uses a single self-contained unit </s>
<s> it is in effect an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled cleaned dehumidified air where it is wanted </s>
<s> in a long rambling ranch two such units can be installed one serving the living area the other the sleeping zone </s>
<s> in a two-story house one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor another in the attic to cool the second </s>
<s> in each case having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control </s>
<s> the heat pump </s>
<s> one of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating </s>
<s> as you know a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors </s>
<s> a relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors </s>
<s> how large a cooling unit you need and the method of its installation depends on a variety of factors </s>
<s> among other things besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family </s>
<s> if you are a party thrower you may need added capacity </s>
<s> cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of aj </s>
<s> a btu is a unit of heat and the btu rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour </s>
<s> coolers are also rated by tons </s>
<s> a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice </s>
<s> you may find a conditioner rated by horsepower </s>
<s> the safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need rather than trying to do this yourself </s>
<s> better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big </s>
<s> reducing humidity is often as important as cooling </s>
<s> an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly then shut down for a long period </s>
<s> before it cycles on again humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low </s>
<s> with a unit of the right size a compressor will run continuously during hot weather reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature </s>
<s> money-saving tips </s>
<s> attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately </s>
<s> in a new house generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution </s>
<s> shade trees too are a big help so keep them if you can </s>
<s> drawn blinds and draperies do some good but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house </s>
<s> the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof the greater its heat impact </s>
<s> a shift in the walls or a change in the roof slope so the sun hits them more obliquely can save you money </s>
<s> you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation </s>
<s> restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house </s>
<s> an attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool </s>
<s> gas adds to the moisture load </s>
<s> insulate weatherstrip double-glaze to the maximum </s>
<s> such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling </s>
<s> it costs two to three times as much to remove a btu in summer as it does to add one in winter so every solitary btu is worth attention </s>
<s> keeping conditioners quiet </s>
<s> avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom </s>
<s> most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning </s>
<s> this is particularly true in site selection </s>
<s> you must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are </s>
<s> you must have a list of requirements on where how many and what type sites are needed </s>
<s> with such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available </s>
<s> begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible </s>
<s> these are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies </s>
<s> the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site </s>
<s> in recent years many counties and the u s forest service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use </s>
<s> inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation </s>
<s> this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions the exposure to the sun and wind the water interests etcetera which vary greatly with the seasons </s>
<s> it is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site </s>
<s> these are a great aid for planning use back at the office </s>
<s> for site planning work it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study </s>
<s> however there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation </s>
<s> county judges commissioners engineers assessors and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences </s>
<s> a visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area </s>
<s> this of course depends on the character of the site itself the previous experience of the investigator and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision </s>
<s> it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone </s>
<s> usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions </s>
<s> a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water </s>
<s> the same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use </s>
<s> in looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements you need information to compare the site with others </s>
<s> you need answers to four important questions </s>
<s> check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site </s>
<s> naturally a park site with scenic views a good lake trees and sand dunes will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes </s>
<s> quality is vitally important </s>
<s> frontage on a body of clear clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water </s>
<s> some recreation features such as scenic values and water interest also have greater overall value than other interests </s>
<s> one of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery </s>
<s> it may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake colorful rock formations or unusual trees </s>
<s> a site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic </s>
<s> an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach </s>
<s> a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs </s>
<s> note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy </s>
<s> water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site </s>
<s> most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas </s>
<s> this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean stream or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing fishing boating and other water sports </s>
<s> a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use </s>
<s> it also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life </s>
<s> the amount of water frontage the quantity and quality of the water and the recreation afforded by it are important </s>
<s> a restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use </s>
<s> the quantity of water flow may be critical </s>
<s> a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer </s>
<s> if the site is on a reservoir the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied </s>
<s> check the quality of the water </s>
<s> a stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area </s>
<s> other factors such as water temperature depth of water the fish life it supports wave action flooding etcetera will affect its recreation value </s>
<s> other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests canyons mountains deserts seacoast beaches sand dunes waterfalls springs etcetera with which the area is blessed </s>
<s> just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area </s>
<s> although the site may not contain the features themselves there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site </s>
<s> the route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them </s>
<s> a group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site </s>
<s> the fish animals and birds which may be found at the site are another interest </s>
<s> fishing interest calls for a check of the species found quantity and size the season they are available and the stocking program of the fish commission </s>
<s> animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas </s>
<s> the site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life </s>
<s> clams crabs and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas </s>
<s> each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done </s>
<s> park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in </s>
<s> the historical sign tells its story but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered </s>
<s> an old shipwreck a high dam an old covered bridge a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold etcetera may be of interest </s>
<s> some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian village sites or hunting areas caves artifacts etcetera </s>
<s> look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use what can be done to correct the faults and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites </s>
<s> many things need to be checked </s>
<s> size and shape </s>
<s> an area may be too small for the needs of the project </s>
<s> areas should be large enough to include the attractions have ample space for the use of facilities needed and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments </s>
<s> acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones </s>
<s> shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development </s>
<s> a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide </s>
<s> this is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions </s>
<s> adjoining areas </s>
<s> for instance a site adjoining other publicly owned lands such as a national forest or a public road may be desirable whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not </s>
<s> the utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site </s>
<s> topography </s>
<s> check the elevation of the ground degree and direction of slopes drainage rock outcrops topsoil types and quality as well as subsoil </s>
<s> nearly level areas are required for parking areas beaches camp areas ballfields etcetera </s>
<s> determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be </s>
<s> water </s>
<s> the quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection </s>
<s> the area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines </s>
<s> figure the cost of providing water to the use areas </s>
<s> plants </s>
<s> look at the trees as to size and interest the amount of shade they provide how healthy they are the problems of maintenance fire hazards wind throw etcetera </s>
<s> an area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up </s>
<s> some shrubs may be of good landscaping value other areas of brush may need to be cleared </s>
<s> the extent and location of open areas is noted </s>
<s> exposure </s>
<s> an area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use </s>
<s> the direction velocity and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area </s>
<s> lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable </s>
<s> sometimes you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade morning sun or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended </s>
<s> improvements </s>
<s> and with sober purpose because the development of prokofieff personifies in many ways the course of music in the union of soviet socialist republics </s>
<s> to the traditionalists it was a brilliant satire on modernism </s>
<s> to the neo-classicists it was a challenge to the pre-war world </s>
<s> a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times </s>
<s> certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon </s>
<s> all musical paris was there </s>
<s> some musicians were enthusiastic some skeptical </s>
<s> certainly america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously and with a good deal of pleasure </s>
<s> his life-long friend serge koussevitzky gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in boston new york and washington dc to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation </s>
<s> we attended the premieres of his concertos symphonies and suites </s>
<s> we studied taught and performed his piano sonatas chamber music gavottes and marches </s>
<s> we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities </s>
<s> we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth-century composers </s>
<s> so young prokofieff was the darling of success in his motherland </s>
<s> meanwhile three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing </s>
<s> in this world-wide conscription of men minds and machines prokofieff was recalled to his native land </s>
<s> the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty and the outraged freedom-loving peoples of the capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist tyranny into cringing submission </s>
<s> after this holocaust a changing world occupied the minds of men </s>
<s> in this changed world prokofieff settled to find himself and to create for large national purpose </s>
<s> here this happy roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world </s>
<s> it is at this point in his life that the mature prokofieff emerges </s>
<s> one might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous </s>
<s> but no prokofieff grew </s>
<s> how right he was </s>
<s> how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism </s>
<s> compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little classical symphony and his big muscular passionate and eloquent fifth symphony </s>
<s> this masterpiece has gaiety too but it is the gaiety of dancing people earthy salty and humorous </s>
<s> of course these works are not comparable even though the same brain conceived them </s>
<s> the early works were conceived for a sophisticated international audience </s>
<s> the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens </s>
<s> prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se </s>
<s> in orchestration he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color </s>
<s> his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable </s>
<s> his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating witty clever adroit and subtle </s>
<s> his counterpoint is pertinent skillful and rarely thick </s>
<s> also it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations the brilliant orchestrations the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema where a large dramatic canvas of sound was required </s>
<s> need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability </s>
<s> prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero who by the force of his creative life helped preserve the main stream of tradition to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated </s>
<s> at this date it seems probable that the name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history as an effective traditionalist who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation and used it as it served his purpose </s>
<s> so prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them </s>
<s> nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would have done better or even as well under different circumstances </s>
<s> his fellow-countryman igor stravinsky certainly did not </s>
<s> when stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures many salons many dialectics many personalities he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles determined by many disparate cultures </s>
<s> but stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting </s>
<s> what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations </s>
<s> meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist </s>
<s> a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto </s>
<s> a circus polka for elephants </s>
<s> his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular american commercial songs </s>
<s> stravinsky nearing the age of eighty is like a lost and frantic bird flitting from one abandoned nest to another searching for a home </s>
<s> prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction </s>
<s> in the process his native endowments were stretched strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose </s>
<s> of course it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him </s>
<s> time and economic security </s>
<s> symphony orchestras opera and ballet companies </s>
<s> choruses chamber music ensembles </s>
<s> soloists </s>
<s> recordings </s>
<s> broadcastings </s>
<s> television </s>
<s> large and eager audiences </s>
<s> thus in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced one of the great composers of the twentieth century </s>
<s> that his moods even in his early years are those of his people does him honor as his music honors those who inspired it </s>
<s> that he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture </s>
<s> roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth century especially the beautifully patterned art of john sell cotman </s>
<s> and like this english master mason realizes his subjects in large simplified masses which though they seem effortless are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them </s>
<s> as a boy roy mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors its tang of weather its change of seasons its variable moods </s>
<s> his father a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature </s>
<s> it is this subject matter that has brought mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors </s>
<s> mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting </s>
<s> but it did teach roy the basic techniques of commercial art and later for twelve years he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia </s>
<s> on the death of their father they returned to their home in batavia new york </s>
<s> after more years of concentrated effort roy and his brother max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand </s>
<s> during all this time roy continued to paint first only on weekends and then as the family business permitted for longer periods </s>
<s> gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether and for the past thirty years he has worked independently as a painter except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions </s>
<s> but even on these the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off </s>
<s> in the best tradition he first taught himself to see then to draw with accuracy and assurance and then to paint </s>
<s> he worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor and his first public recognition and early honors including his election to the academy were for his essays in the heavier medium </s>
<s> gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major if not exclusive technique </s>
<s> it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason on numerous occasions mostly in the vicinity of batavia </s>
<s> more often than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed not imitative painting </s>
<s> what i have observed time and time again is a process of integration integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form </s>
<s> color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition </s>
<s> and that over-all amazing control of large washes which is the mason stylemark </s>
<s> finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done </s>
<s> if a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture i try to place them in the initial sketch </s>
<s> for me these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage though i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose </s>
<s> as a result such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him </s>
<s> just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting unless the position serves the design of the whole composition </s>
<s> if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design often only slightly finer pictures would result </s>
<s> out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees logs and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position which i call clicking </s>
<s> often in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright too dull or too light or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat </s>
<s> when this linear draft is completed i dust it down to a faint image </s>
<s> from this point i paint in as direct a manner as possible by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage </s>
<s> however first i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines i have described </s>
<s> the longer i work the more i am sure that for me at least a workmanlike method is important </s>
<s> trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting </s>
<s> i work on a watercolor easel in the field and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain </s>
<s> in my studio i work at a tilt-top table but leave the paper unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes </s>
<s> then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board </s>
<s> the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist </s>
<s> i also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio </s>
<s> and a very large flat wash brush </s>
<s> in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here </s>
<s> true a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory </s>
<s> a middle distance often containing the major motif </s>
<s> and a background usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky </s>
<s> in following this general principle mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background and the illusion of depth is instantly created </s>
<s> he does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject </s>
<s> rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory his imagination his nostalgia </s>
<s> it is for this reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment </s>
<s> his pictures generalize though they are inspired by a particular locale </s>
<s> they universalize in terms of weather skies earth and people </s>
<s> by dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way roy mason has found a particular niche in american landscape art </s>
<s> living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all </s>
<s> and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes and how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again in his natal month of march </s>
<s> two ranger fund purchase awards </s>
<s> the joseph pennell memorial medal </s>
<s> two american watercolor society prizes </s>
<s> the blair purchase prize for watercolor art institute of chicago </s>

<s> our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance </s>
<s> the russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics </s>
<s> after all we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics competition </s>
<s> it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem for just as gymnastics can learn from dance dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics </s>
<s> it is made up of tumbling which might be said to start with a somersault run through such stunts as headstands handstands cartwheels backbends and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work </s>
<s> the parallel bars horse buck springboard horizontal bar rings and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball volleyball basketball and football </s>
<s> but the russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one endurance </s>
<s> the gymnast must develop strength flexibility coordination timing rhythm courage discipline persistence and the desire for perfection </s>
<s> in short gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well </s>
<s> the addition of endurance training later when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury provides that final quality that makes the top athlete soldier or citizen </s>
<s> another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life </s>
<s> most europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries </s>
<s> the american is very lucky if he has three </s>
<s> if a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools </s>
<s> first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension since action relieves both </s>
<s> oddly enough it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty </s>
<s> eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself </s>
<s> a great deal </s>
<s> well-stretched trained in posture and coordinated movement and wedded to rhythm they presented the audiences in rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic contest </s>
<s> american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons </s>
<s> they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace </s>
<s> president kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation </s>
<s> if we wait until children are in junior high or high school we will never manage it </s>
<s> to be fit one has to start early with young children and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance </s>
<s> if the dance teachers of america make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible we will be that much ahead </s>
<s> school teachers all too unprepared for the job they must do will need demonstrators </s>
<s> there should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand and also how to help other children learn it </s>
<s> they should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught </s>
<s> dancers do have flexibility </s>
<s> they often fail however to develop real abdominal back chest shoulder and arm strength </s>
<s> ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results considering the amount of physical training they have had will be very disappointing </s>
<s> even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas </s>
<s> the only area in which american boys hold their own is the baseball throw </s>
<s> the chinning bar </s>
<s> for arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended </s>
<s> it should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone and a chair should be placed under it a little to one side </s>
<s> those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it </s>
<s> those who are too weak should climb on the chair and starting at the top of the chin let themselves slowly down </s>
<s> when they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent they will have the strength to chin-up </s>
<s> parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home </s>
<s> the horse kick </s>
<s> arm shoulder chest upper and lower back strength will be aided with the horse kick </s>
<s> start on hands and feet </s>
<s> keeping the hands in the starting position run in place to a quick rhythm </s>
<s> after this has become easy use slower and slower rhythms kicking higher and higher </s>
<s> follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours kicking as high as possible </s>
<s> push-ups </s>
<s> push-ups are essential but few have the strength for them at first </s>
<s> start on the knees in a large circle </s>
<s> fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor </s>
<s> push back up and repeat </s>
<s> do this exercise six times each class period </s>
<s> as strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward </s>
<s> start by falling forward to a point close to the feet and as strength improves fall farther and farther out </s>
<s> try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands </s>
<s> the push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide </s>
<s> let the body down slowly taking at least five seconds for the letting down </s>
<s> five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up </s>
<s> handstands </s>
<s> handstands come after arms chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength </s>
<s> of course those who have developed more will find them easier </s>
<s> start with the class standing in a circle with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle </s>
<s> at first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone and those who need help </s>
<s> drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back </s>
<s> the left will follow at once </s>
<s> the right will land first followed by the left </s>
<s> return to the standing position </s>
<s> care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible </s>
<s> this will prevent flat falls and toe injuries </s>
<s> bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper </s>
<s> eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg </s>
<s> the child should then bring both legs together overhead point the toes and tighten the seat muscles </s>
<s> be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time </s>
<s> backbends </s>

<s> the host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality </s>
<s> when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment the prospect is staggering </s>
<s> the author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that in this area alone the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities </s>
<s> the benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery </s>
<s> electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine the electrocardiograph and the diathermy machine </s>
<s> recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises contusions and simple bursitis </s>
<s> commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction along with radiation counters timers and similar devices </s>
<s> from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research </s>
<s> ultraviolet microscopy </s>
<s> many cells bacteria and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation </s>
<s> this stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside </s>
<s> a completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-tv system to view the results </s>
<s> by combining the talents of a medical man dr aterman a biophysicist mr berkely and an electronics expert dr zworykin this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes </s>
<s> three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources </s>
<s> these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror </s>
<s> the specimen is magnified by the microscope </s>
<s> the microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum which means that all lenses must be quartz </s>
<s> the video signal is amplified and then switched in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength corresponding to red green or blue is seen </s>
<s> the result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths </s>
<s> many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum </s>
<s> different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color </s>
<s> where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail </s>
<s> at the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it </s>
<s> usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill standing still or in some other medically significant position </s>
<s> from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail </s>
<s> heart-measuring techniques </s>
<s> for many of these measurements the chest must be opened but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed </s>
<s> a group of researchers at the university of washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques </s>
<s> one simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube filled with mercury around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched </s>
<s> a balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed </s>
<s> sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy </s>
<s> a sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation </s>
<s> in addition to the heart and aorta successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique </s>
<s> the doppler effect using ultrasonic signals can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel </s>
<s> a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself </s>
<s> it uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream </s>
<s> the latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow </s>
<s> this pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made </s>
<s> outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder </s>
<s> from this doctors can read heart rate change in diameter pressure and effective heart power </s>
<s> radio-transmitter pills </s>
<s> several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers </s>
<s> a refinement of this technique has been described by drs zworykin and farrar and mr berkely of the medical electronics center of the rockefeller institute </s>
<s> applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments </s>
<s> sonar in medical research </s>
<s> one of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body </s>
<s> our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects </s>
<s> various methods of pulsing scanning and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines map ocean floors and even communicate under water </s>
<s> in medicine the frequencies are much higher transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller and different scanning techniques may be used but the principles involved are the same as in sonar </s>
<s> because the body contains so much liquid transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels </s>
<s> bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals </s>
<s> a good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by dr g baum who has explored the human eye </s>
<s> he can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma </s>
<s> the transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath not shown </s>
<s> for display dr baum uses a portion of an af an airborne radar indicator and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record </s>
<s> drs howry and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results </s>

<s> his father soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family let alone educate them in a town without even a school </s>
<s> the two older boys hans and anders his junior by a year therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german </s>
<s> his wife taught the two boys to read and write danish </s>
<s> other brothers later joined them for instruction with oldenburg the wigmaker and also arithmetic was added to bible reading german and danish in the informal curriculum </s>
<s> from the town surveyor hans learned drawing and mathematics and from a university student some academic subjects </s>
<s> the mayor of the town taught them english and french </s>
<s> whatever hans or anders learned separately they passed on to each other </s>

<s> ferment of scientific activity </s>
<s> hans student days were at a time when europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america and in france germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the continent </s>
<s> the new century opened with oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen and as lecturer at the university </s>
<s> the sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him </s>
<s> he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries </s>
<s> however he continued experimenting and lecturing publishing the results of his experiments in german and danish periodicals </s>
<s> he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood </s>
<s> the university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level </s>
<s> his broad interest in literary political and philosophical movements opened many doors to him </s>
<s> his friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong </s>
<s> his interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated </s>
<s> the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison </s>
<s> it is true that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication </s>
<s> but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference </s>
<s> the form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form </s>
<s> there forces are more latent than in electricity and less than in magnetism </s>
<s> but in such an important question we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty and not a thing which is contrary to it </s>
<s> one could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature just as electrical bodies do </s>
<s> it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature as proven by bruckmann and coulomb </s>
<s> by that one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces </s>
<s> his plan and intent were clearly charted </s>
<s> in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship </s>
<s> he continued as a popular lecturer </s>
<s> he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current </s>
<s> it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition lauritz esmarch that oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow </s>
<s> together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper thereby producing stronger currents </s>
<s> discovery of electromagnetism </s>
<s> electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles </s>
<s> beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic </s>
<s> the resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise </s>
<s> the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces </s>
<s> at this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle </s>

<s> problems in the market </s>
<s> greater price-consciousness </s>

<s> there is every indication it will continue </s>
<s> frequently wittingly or unwittingly price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers distributors and dealers </s>
<s> here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target </s>
<s> increased customer sophistication </s>
<s> average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions </s>
<s> this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses </s>
<s> greater demand for services </s>
<s> there are two reasons for this </s>
<s> first most products tend to become more complex </s>
<s> second in a competitive market the customer feels his weight and throws it around </s>
<s> providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product </s>
<s> too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction </s>
<s> good service starts with product design and planning many products seem to be designed for a production economy not for a service one </s>
<s> proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization and your distributor organizations not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations </s>
<s> wider discretionary choices for customers </s>
<s> in spending his money today the consumer is pulled in many directions </s>
<s> geographic shift of customers </s>
<s> market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts </s>
<s> instead of relatively small sales to many accounts there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts </s>
<s> problems in marketing methods </s>
<s> more private label competition </s>
<s> in the area of private label competition it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade </s>
<s> average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded </s>
<s> less personal salesmanship </s>
<s> display merchandising backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion will continue to make strides in the sixties </s>
<s> it has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program </s>
<s> higher costs of distribution generally </s>
<s> some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes </s>
<s> no manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved </s>
<s> the use of bulk handling is continuously growing </s>
<s> computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels </s>
<s> there may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain </s>
<s> as a result distribution costs were cut customer relations improved </s>
<s> higher costs of advertising and promotion </s>
<s> it is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods and private label competition </s>
<s> increasing tempo of new product development </s>
<s> practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon </s>
<s> if competition beats you to it this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store </s>
<s> on the other hand the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive </s>
<s> as markets become larger and marketing more complex the costs of an error become progressively larger </s>
<s> are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization </s>
<s> who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume production and distribution costs </s>
<s> problems in marketing management </s>
<s> shortage of skilled salesmen </s>
<s> there is a shortage of salesmen today </s>
<s> in the future quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy and the qualitative need will be greater still </s>
<s> while many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel much of it has been product rather than sales training </s>
<s> nor has the training been enough in relation to the need </s>
<s> most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements </s>
<s> shortage of sales management talent </s>
<s> men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work </s>
<s> the growth of business has outdistanced the available supply and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties </s>
<s> complexity of complete marketing planning </s>
<s> every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning </s>
<s> many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis </s>
<s> they have to be </s>
<s> we find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning </s>
<s> solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems whether they be in the market in marketing methods or in marketing management </s>
<s> if companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade </s>
<s> the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion </s>
<s> the architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that therefore the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building </s>
<s> it is true that most architectural schools have five year courses some even have six or more </s>
<s> the element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification however would demand a prolonged study of structure </s>
<s> we may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject </s>
<s> the american institute of interior designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course </s>
<s> one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum but the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions </s>
<s> the suggested course of the aid was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities </s>
<s> obviously the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated </s>
<s> makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture floor coverings wall decorations and determines color schemes </s>
<s> furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval </s>
<s> this seems like a large order </s>
<s> the interior designer then must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance </s>
<s> yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it </s>
<s> and further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society </s>
<s> few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum </s>
<s> it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise </s>
<s> the old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations </s>
<s> yet even here many a problem is presented </s>
<s> working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design </s>
<s> unfortunately the purely synthetic problem is the rule </s>
<s> it is like medical schools in india where in that fairy-land of religious inhibition the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon </s>
<s> instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants </s>
<s> thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience </s>
<s> in the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use </s>
<s> but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable </s>
<s> consultation with architects clients real estate men fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work </s>
<s> here too the reality of actual furniture must be experienced </s>
<s> the professional organizations such as american institute of interior designers national society of interior designers home fashions league and various trade associations can and do aid greatly in this work </s>
<s> certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations </s>
<s> not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject </s>
<s> participation for the educator in this case however would have to be raised to full and complete membership </s>
<s> the largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and indeed refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog </s>
<s> this anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students </s>
<s> the professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice </s>
<s> this seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands </s>
<s> in one way the institutes and societies do a disservice to the schools </s>
<s> when these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth </s>
<s> the necessity of that day has long disappeared </s>
<s> there is plenty of opportunity for proper education today </s>
<s> it is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand </s>
<s> beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves </s>
<s> it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students </s>
<s> the local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications </s>
<s> nor will the hack the jack-of-all-trades still found in some of the smaller art schools suffice </s>
<s> only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design </s>
<s> this kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer </s>
<s> considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture furniture design textiles and color is also desirable </s>
<s> it is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in english history psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art especially interior design as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects </s>
<s> the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed </s>
<s> the matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account </s>
<s> one technical question of school organization comes to mind here </s>
<s> for proper accreditation of schools teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate </s>
<s> since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed </s>
<s> indeed it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all </s>
<s> the question however cannot be ignored for long </s>
<s> the basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree </s>
<s> most professors in the course must naturally again have a higher degree than the course offers </s>
<s> one solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute </s>
<s> it is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it </s>
<s> this brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general </s>
<s> only the independent art schools that is those not connected with any university or college receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations </s>
<s> it has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department </s>
<s> this plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department yet nevertheless claiming that they teach interior design has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design </s>
<s> in spite of this many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject </s>
<s> independent art schools granting degrees must naturally follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group </s>

<s> camp meals are no great problem </s>

<s> scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it </s>
<s> we have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important </s>
<s> and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols support of the dual-ladder plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions </s>
<s> with no set standards there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance </s>

<s> but oakwood heights is unique in one particular </s>
<s> its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point </s>
<s> this is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in delaware as the tri-state pipeline corporation with principal offices in new york state </s>
<s> vice-president is louis berkman and the secretary-treasurer is mark ritter </s>
<s> ritter is the builder of oakwood heights and president of kahler-craft distributors inc newburgh ny </s>
<s> the idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty </s>
<s> this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered </s>
<s> rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family </s>
<s> as a result of that attitude others have been discouraged from trying central distribution </s>
<s> a new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at oakwood heights </s>
<s> tri-state has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern principal heating states </s>
<s> the earlier new haven development was public housing so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture </s>
<s> these have to do with property rights municipal official attitudes and a host of others </s>
<s> in working out the practical legal conclusions president waters was not thinking only of this pilot project for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally </s>
<s> it is always difficult or at least time-consuming to get approval of any kind of line under a public street as one example </s>
<s> to overcome this the builder lays and completes the street himself then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines </s>
<s> when a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to tri-state </s>
<s> for the central storage tri-state buys one acre buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece </s>
<s> in other words the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to tri-state </s>
<s> it leases the whole facility to a large oil company at least large enough to have a strong credit position </s>
<s> the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties </s>
<s> the supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies </s>
<s> however that is not all he has to do </s>
<s> he must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating </s>
<s> in the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups </s>
<s> again the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best </s>
<s> for this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor </s>
<s> the major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low </s>
<s> initial considerations </s>
<s> the officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles as well as personalities that might be affected </s>
<s> the central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing with fewer trucks in the residential streets </s>
<s> the public service commission has ruled that this is not a public utility subject to their many regulations </s>
<s> several financial institutions both banks and insurance companies have been sounded out </s>
<s> they like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies </s>
<s> the government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation </s>
<s> there must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil an obvious precaution since the account is permanently wedded just like with gas or electricity </s>
<s> the meter is mounted high on the basement wall </s>
<s> its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read even into tenth gallons </s>
<s> it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour </s>
<s> ritter the builder is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters </s>
<s> he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available </s>
<s> the job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging </s>
<s> but in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple </s>
<s> future plans </s>

<s> others were building </s>

<s> plastics combine such properties as built-in color light weight optional transparency or translucency resistance to corrosion as well as the ease of fabrication </s>
<s> plastic signs are economical </s>
<s> shipping cost is also reduced </s>
<s> the weight advantage plus greater durability of the plastic unit yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping </s>
<s> the lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed </s>
<s> finally maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs </s>
<s> they offer exceptional design freedom making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer </s>

<s> trans-illuminated billboards </s>
<s> one of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance neon sign co los angeles and industrial electric inc new orleans la </s>
<s> the essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former constructed of translucent plastic panels are lighted from within </s>
<s> with the source of light behind the copy there is no loss of lumen output as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light </s>
<s> also the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign </s>
<s> the copy itself including any text or illustrations is reproduced in full color directly on a thin mylar polyester film by a photo screen process </s>
<s> the film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required </s>
<s> spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another </s>
<s> new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip </s>
<s> panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied </s>
<s> signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities and others are on the way </s>
<s> it is believed that these boards will within the next few years replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use </s>
<s> trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions </s>
<s> thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces </s>
<s> they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces </s>
<s> in this way the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media </s>

<s> your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group </s>
<s> with the exception of the sports cars even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation </s>
<s> the basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car but some of them offer supplementary advantages </s>
<s> a little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits </s>
<s> the investigation will be well worth your time </s>
<s> all model cars are not available in all countries </s>
<s> quite naturally there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country </s>
<s> if you would like to start your tour in italy where the rental fees are actually the lowest in europe fiats in all sizes are available as are alfa romeo giulietta models </s>
<s> with six in the group the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee </s>
<s> the same model car might be available in six or eight countries yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven </s>
<s> the variations are not too great </s>
<s> rates in greece and finland are fairly high actually the highest in europe and surprisingly enough they are also quite high in ireland </s>
<s> if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a month it might be wise for you to lease a car </s>
<s> the actual over-all cost for the first month will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time but you will receive a new car </s>
<s> you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout europe </s>
<s> further there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip </s>
<s> leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in europe but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory </s>
<s> there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan </s>
<s> for one thing the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road </s>
<s> then too european drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them </s>
<s> still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of europe by car </s>
<s> the way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car </s>
<s> the big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed </s>
<s> the fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars </s>
<s> aside from the comico-romantico content here a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on </s>
<s> and the drawling oversoft voice of flirtation though fairly overt was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture </s>
<s> in other words like automation machines designed to work in tandem they shared the same programming a mutual understanding not only of english words but of the four stresses pitches and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white </s>
<s> at this point unfortunately romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture </s>
<s> but consider if you can bear it what might have happened if macarthur for some perverse undaunted reason had made the same remark to an eskimo girl in eskimo </s>

<s> but communication no </s>
<s> it is only fairly recently however that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people </s>
<s> this for obvious reasons makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview so useful in fact that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy </s>
<s> for example if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother </s>
<s> and while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired </s>
<s> an accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp </s>
<s> the joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established in point of fact that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world </s>
<s> since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of redstone proportions in new research and training </s>
<s> newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level </s>
<s> by adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist </s>

<s> so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce </s>
<s> this the therapist may pursue in later questioning </s>
<s> since the psychiatric interview like any other interview depends on communication it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience </s>
<s> his own communication apparatus operated superbly and lillian ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted monumentally unmeshed mechanism of dr blauberman </s>
<s> almost everyone on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again </s>
<s> to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen </s>
<s> what he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved </s>
<s> some of the classic indicators as described by drs pittenger hockett and danehy in the first five minutes are these ambiguity of pronouns </s>
<s> stammering or repetition of i you he she et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty </s>

<s> for in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons </s>

<s> the following month the invasion of italy was begun and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern italy </s>

<s> so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey </s>

<s> like hell </s>

<s> there were lights glinting in the city too even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible </s>
<s> bari was asking for it he thought </s>
<s> for five days now they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold </s>
<s> richardson wondered when it would be unloaded </s>
<s> he hoped they would put in somewhere way way down in the earth </s>
<s> the burden of his secret was pressing down on him as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men </s>
<s> lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs </s>

<s> nine of them had gone down the gangplank already </s>
<s> deck cadet james l cahill and seaman walter brooks had been the first to leave </s>
<s> the other half of the crew plus beckstrom and his men had remained aboard </s>
<s> richardson glanced to sea and started slightly </s>

<s> then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver and he glanced upward </s>
<s> his eyes boggled </s>
<s> it was a clear night and it was raining </s>
<s> but he had mistaken it for bugs </s>
<s> musmanno was on deck </s>

<s> the little unsinkable sank almost immediately </s>
<s> captain musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft </s>
<s> they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under </s>
<s> john bascom went down early too </s>
<s> ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly but they had no targets </s>

<s> this experience will have happened to many of you </s>
<s> in this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually </s>
<s> when a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream we have an instance of deja vue except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar </s>
<s> occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude </s>
<s> one day maeterlinck coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified </s>
<s> the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something about myself </s>
<s> at that moment kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier </s>
<s> freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts </s>
<s> dreams present many mysteries of telepathy clairvoyance prevision and retrovision </s>
<s> the basic mystery of dreams which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream is in the fact that they are original visual continuities </s>
<s> i recall the startling vivid realism of a dream in which i lived through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town </s>
<s> i am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence so complete in detail from the hodge-podge of news pictures i have seen </s>
<s> skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence </s>
<s> every dream and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available </s>
<s> in most cases we recognize certain words persons animals or objects </s>
<s> for instance the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and with photographic realism sees smith driving the car </s>
<s> whereas it is a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car </s>
<s> there is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams </s>
<s> the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support </s>
<s> dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components including that weird feeling of deja vue inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem </s>
<s> as in the theory of perception established in psycho-physiology the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain </s>
<s> but then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain </s>
<s> hereby the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen not the retinal image the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers motor tensions associated word symbols and consciousness </s>
<s> modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy </s>
<s> we know that the number of radio and television impulses sound waves ultra-violet rays etc that may occupy the very same space each solitary upon its own frequency is infinite </s>
<s> so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal apparently momentary states of matter successive one after another in consciousness but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies </s>
<s> this theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness </s>
<s> space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions </s>
<s> it is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past or the ever-existent past-fantasy future </s>
<s> three seconds flat is the usual time and the space is crossed by moderate mileage while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events </s>
<s> the body senses and brain in common with all matter have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies </s>
<s> the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible inaudible and intactible to them </s>
<s> consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions </s>
<s> when consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep </s>
<s> if the photographically realistic continuity of dreams however bizarre their combinations denies that it is purely a composition of the brain it must be compounded from views of diverse realities although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life </s>
<s> as a matter of fact the incorrect classification the result of many weeks of labor by dr hilprecht was about to be published by him the following day </s>
<s> dr hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream </s>
<s> he was almost positive it was not assyrian nor cassite and imagined it must have been german or english </s>
<s> the degree of circumstance the ratio of memory to forgetfulness determines whether a dream will be a recognized fulfilled prevision or the vaguely effective source of the weird deja vue feeling </s>
<s> probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake </s>
<s> when we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority they of course cannot impress us as anything familiar </s>
<s> nevertheless there are notably frequent instances of deja vue in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before a feeling which though vague withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists </s>
<s> if deja vue is an illusion then peculiarly it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people </s>
<s> chauncey depew one-time runner-up for the republican presidential nomination was attending a convention at saratoga where he was scheduled to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met </s>

<s> if depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue </s>
<s> but the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene </s>

<s> so wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from north country school lake placid new york </s>
<s> in this one sentence he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school </s>
<s> because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value care for its origin and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients the food does taste good </s>
<s> when served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments the athletic programs and the most important phase the educational opportunities </s>
<s> situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands </s>
<s> from fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-september to june </s>
<s> the director walter e clark believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare </s>
<s> to him this means caring for the whole child providing basic nutrition and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind </s>
<s> improved farming methods </s>
<s> the concept of good nutrition really began with the garden </s>
<s> the school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school </s>
<s> in a climate hostile to agriculture mr clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques </s>
<s> throughout the adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat </s>
<s> mr clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil </s>
<s> he locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains </s>
<s> the basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program poultry for eggs pigs to eat garbage a beef herd and wastes of all kinds </s>
<s> separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells </s>
<s> it was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader </s>
<s> years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity </s>
<s> soon after the method changed visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist when in reality it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this </s>
<s> to demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today mr clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth </s>
<s> the garden supplies enough carrots turnips rutabagas potatoes beets cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar </s>
<s> the cabbage and squash keep until march or april </s>
<s> there is never enough corn peas or strawberries </s>
<s> mr clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future </s>
<s> a new project planned is the use of bio-dynamic starter </s>
<s> new ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment </s>
<s> the first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread </s>
<s> at first the kitchen help was tolerant but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves </s>
<s> of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread but the children liked it better </s>
<s> homemade bread </s>
<s> mrs clark as house manager planned the menus and cared for the ordering </s>
<s> then miss lillian colman came from vermont to be kitchen manager </s>
<s> today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread </s>
<s> once the grains are ground vitamin e begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week </s>
<s> a mill stands in a room off the kitchen </s>
<s> surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state </s>
<s> miss colman pours measures of whole wheat oats and soy beans and turns on the motor </s>
<s> she goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding </s>
<s> the bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma </s>
<s> it is well liked by the children and faculty </s>
<s> there is one problem with the bread </s>
<s> hot freshly-ground cereal </s>
<s> the school has not used cold prepared cereals for years though at one time that was all they ever served </s>
<s> when the chance came they first eliminated cold cereal once a week then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day </s>
<s> they serve cracked wheat oats or cornmeal </s>

<s> oranges and grapefruit are shipped from florida weekly from an organic farm </s>
<s> finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem </s>
<s> sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways </s>
<s> following a talk by mr clark at the new york state natural food associates convention a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from vermont </s>
<s> miss colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables </s>
<s> raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves </s>
<s> very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged </s>
<s> drinking with meals is also discouraged </s>
<s> pitchers of water merely appear on the tables </s>
<s> nothing is peeled </s>
<s> the source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues </s>
<s> the cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin c content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible </s>
<s> wholesome snacks no candy </s>
<s> since mr clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons </s>
<s> to solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains </s>
<s> on their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail </s>
<s> they tasted good to him so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey </s>
<s> maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds </s>
<s> this and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking </s>
<s> candy is not allowed </s>
<s> parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts but no candy </s>
<s> nourishing meals </s>

<s> the heavy meal comes in the middle of the day </s>
<s> soup is often the important dish at supper </s>
<s> homemade of meat bones and vegetables it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins </s>
<s> the school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality </s>
<s> the cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day </s>
<s> outdoor exercises </s>
<s> even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition mr clark felt the school had a good health program </s>
<s> rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule </s>

<s> there was no such thing as an airport in vermont </s>
<s> the only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged montpelier was on the towne farm off upper main street a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions </s>
<s> over in barre the streets had been deep in swirling water and bridges were crumpled and gone </s>
<s> though the makeshift airports were ready the york state guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule </s>
<s> it seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air </s>

<s> tall wiry dark-haired bob fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history </s>
<s> in concord bob fogg was the most prominent new hampshire boy with wings </s>
<s> public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map </s>
<s> so with all this experience bob fogg was a natural choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract </s>
<s> his work began just six days after the flood </s>
<s> between the unsafe towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to wilson flat arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory </s>
<s> each time in the unhappy pilot pushing his luck begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place preferably on the flat-topped hills across the winooski river </s>
<s> it took a tragedy to bring things to a head </s>
<s> after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an army plane strewn across snow-covered towne field </s>
<s> sent to montpelier by secretary herbert hoover red cross aide reuben sleight had been killed and his pilot lt franklin wolfe badly injured </s>
<s> with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside </s>
<s> faced with this situation postmaster charles f mckenna of montpelier went with fogg on a burlington trip and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of berlin </s>
<s> a long flat known as the st john field seemed to answer their purpose and since the winooski bridges were at last passable they decided to use it </s>
<s> as a wind direction indicator they tied a cotton rag to a sapling </s>
<s> each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches </s>
<s> each morning at five fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home </s>
<s> a sheep-lined leather flying suit plus helmet goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit </s>
<s> as daylight began to show through the frosty windows fogg would place a call to william a shaw at the u s weather station at northfield vermont for temperature and wind-velocity readings </s>
<s> shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station </s>
<s> later on in the day fogg could get a better weather picture from the burlington weather bureau supervised by frank e hartwell </s>
<s> plane radios were not yet available and once in the air fogg flew his ship by compass a good memory for landmarks as seen from above and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation </s>
<s> often threading through the overcast he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling skimming above the winooski or the white river along the line of the broken railroad </s>
<s> when driving rain or mist socked in one valley fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one ranging from the ottauquechee up to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes </s>
<s> the dependable wright engine was never stopped on these trips </s>
<s> it ticked over smoothly idling while fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen and one from montpelier and barre at the st john field </s>
<s> day after day fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country </s>
<s> the flyer had his share of near-misses </s>
<s> at fort ethan allen the ever-present wind off lake champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated </s>
<s> once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while fogg revved the engine and got the tail up </s>
<s> at a nod of his head they let go turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream </s>

<s> an important criterion of maturity is creativity </s>
<s> the mature person is creative </s>
<s> when we turn to noah webster we find him helpful as usual </s>
<s> we are creative it seems when we produce something which has not previously existed </s>
<s> thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake building a chicken coop or producing a book to founding a business creating a league of nations or developing a mature character </s>
<s> all living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity if it is only to reproduce a form like their own </s>
<s> while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability </s>
<s> an animal bird or insect creates either a burrow or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie </s>
<s> this gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms </s>
<s> it has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world </s>
<s> in our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a jules verne come into actuality </s>
<s> it is in this one aspect at least that man seems to be made in the image of his creator </s>
<s> not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms but even more importantly he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself </s>
<s> we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes acrobats dancers musicians and artists developing many potentialities </s>
<s> we know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles </s>
<s> by this same combination of the will and the imagination each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be </s>
<s> so far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created </s>
<s> is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy </s>
<s> sir julian huxley in his book uniqueness of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity </s>
<s> some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote victorian past </s>
<s> that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation </s>
<s> joking and talking may be freer and easier but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women </s>
<s> various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both </s>
<s> privacy must be highly assured both in time and place </s>
<s> that is locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment </s>
<s> first intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen </s>
<s> ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety misunderstanding and suspicion </s>
<s> the hymen is in essence a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations </s>
<s> often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse </s>
<s> as might be expected girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity </s>
<s> it is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one </s>
<s> so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations </s>
<s> but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs </s>
<s> some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood </s>
<s> more rarely the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration </s>
<s> extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated </s>
<s> these cases for all their rarity are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds </s>
<s> in recent times when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention </s>
<s> obviously the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation </s>
<s> gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage </s>
<s> if he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or preferably to dilate it </s>
<s> as a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina </s>
<s> this recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act </s>
<s> the vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation </s>
<s> this is obvious when it is remembered that during childbirth the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby </s>
<s> the intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control </s>
<s> but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman </s>
<s> that is when first penetration takes place the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain </s>
<s> the advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological </s>
<s> since it is a purely professional situation none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved </s>
<s> by using instruments of gradually increasing size the vagina is gently and with minimum pain at each stage taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape </s>
<s> in this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl </s>
<s> apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment </s>
<s> it is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation </s>
<s> when no medical problems exist the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves </s>
<s> special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value </s>
<s> folk-lore superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints </s>
<s> the importance of loving tenderness is obvious </s>
<s> the long unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels </s>
<s> under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration </s>
<s> and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times </s>
<s> these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse </s>
<s> the husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind </s>
<s> they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina </s>
<s> at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making </s>
<s> in fact the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon </s>
<s> locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration </s>
<s> the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all </s>
<s> such talk is seriously in error </s>
<s> ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride both physically and psychologically </s>
<s> the insistent forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen </s>
<s> the pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her unconsciously to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it </s>
<s> the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax </s>
<s> this is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife </s>
<s> or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period </s>
<s> the signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them </s>
<s> the best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again </s>
<s> this may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered </s>
<s> he can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost </s>
<s> now while he uses talk caresses or requires caresses from her his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire </s>
<s> a final word </s>
<s> the accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman </s>
<s> too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment </s>
<s> only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse </s>
<s> both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid </s>
<s> if the early approaches are wise understanding and patient the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older </s>
<s> perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions attitudes and emotions precipitated by the nude form </s>
<s> the wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the kinsey studies in human sexuality </s>
<s> differences were related to social economic and educational backgrounds </s>
<s> whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations </s>
<s> attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions </s>
<s> one is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected </s>
<s> in tradition and in poetry the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony </s>
<s> the partners each bring to it unselfish love and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy </s>
<s> at its most ecstatic moments husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares </s>
<s> everything else is closed away </s>
<s> this is the ideal </s>
<s> but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved </s>
<s> instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship </s>
<s> in the past it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive </s>
<s> but today there are signs that these roles are being reversed </s>
<s> in a growing number of american homes marriage counselors report the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships </s>
<s> it is she who decides the time the place the surroundings and the frequency of the sexual act </s>
<s> the whole act is tailored to her pleasure and not to theirs </s>
<s> but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed </s>
<s> yet even in these marriages psychologists say wives are asserting themselves more strongly </s>
<s> to many experts this trend was inevitable </s>
<s> they consider it simply a sign of our times </s>
<s> it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role </s>
<s> yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous </s>
<s> it can in fact wreck a marriage </s>
<s> and she begins to regard him as savage bestial and unworthy </s>
<s> on the other hand wifely supremacy demeans the husband saps his self-respect and robs him of his masculinity </s>
<s> to win her favors her husband first took an additional job then desperately began to embezzle from his employer </s>
<s> caught at last he was sentenced to prison </s>
<s> while he was in custody his wife divorced him </s>
<s> more typical is the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage counselor </s>
<s> to please her her husband assumed some of the domestic chores </s>
<s> one wife described by a new york psychologist so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule writing it down right between the weekly pta meetings and the thursday-night neighborhood card parties </s>
<s> another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis </s>
<s> experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed </s>
<s> she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband </s>
<s> sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage </s>
<s> hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area </s>
<s> more often though he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home </s>
<s> some psychologists in fact suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives </s>
<s> naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative </s>
<s> unless her husband also desires sex the act cannot be consummated </s>
<s> no one seriously contends of course that the domineering wife is sexually speaking a new character in our world </s>
<s> after all the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing in literature and on the stage as dr schillinger points out </s>
<s> there is no evidence that these milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom </s>
<s> furthermore dr calderone says a certain number of docile retiring men always have been around </s>
<s> they like to be dominated </s>
<s> one such man once confided to dr theodor reik new york psychiatrist that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor </s>
<s> but such cases were in the past unusual </s>
<s> and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything including the marriage bed </s>
<s> in those days a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere </s>
<s> some date it from woman suffrage others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin </s>
<s> virtually everyone agrees however that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs </s>
<s> left alone while her husband was miles away in the city the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male </s>
<s> circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing money-handling and home maintenance </s>
<s> she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless </s>
<s> she liked this taste of authority and independence and with darkness was not likely to give it up </s>
<s> not surprisingly dr ellis says some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities </s>
<s> yet paradoxically according to dr maurice linden many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them </s>
<s> an aggressive woman wants a man to demand not knuckle under </s>
<s> one such wife dr linden says became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man </s>
<s> but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover too had been conquered and reduced to passivity </s>
<s> then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list </s>
<s> in some cases however domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need </s>
<s> if his on-the-job problems work out he may return to his old pattern </s>
<s> or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted flattered or coaxed simply because she needs her ego lifted </s>
<s> other experts say however that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period it is likely to shake the marriage </s>
<s> and just as domination today often begins with the wife so the cure generally must lie with the husband </s>
<s> he must begin paradoxically by becoming more selfish </s>

<s> one main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth </s>
<s> a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth an overdeveloped lower jawbone and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion </s>
<s> these two basic malformations have of course many variations </s>
<s> a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions </s>
<s> a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw </s>
<s> crooked overlapping twisted or widely spaced teeth </s>
<s> front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close </s>
<s> upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close </s>
<s> second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out making a double row </s>
<s> but after that if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent it will have an effect </s>
<s> malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long </s>
<s> if a child loses a molar at the age of two the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble </s>
<s> if baby teeth are retained too long the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place </s>
<s> correction can save teeth </s>
<s> every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth </s>
<s> some such youngsters rarely smile or they try to speak with the mouth closed </s>
<s> bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots </s>
<s> this serious condition popularly known as pyorrhea is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults </s>
<s> then too misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles increasing the likelihood of rapid decay </s>

<s> orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network to the bone in the jaw </s>
<s> they are not anchored directly to the bone </s>
<s> abnormal pressure applied over a period of time produces a change in the bony deposit so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided </s>
<s> if he decides to proceed he will custom-make for susie an appliance consisting of bands plastic plates fine wires and tiny springs </s>
<s> this appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone </s>
<s> as the tooth moves bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved </s>
<s> this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows and no faster </s>
<s> during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness but after a short time this will disappear </s>
<s> parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay </s>
<s> when in place a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered </s>
<s> next susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month depending on the severity of her condition </s>
<s> during these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth </s>
<s> last comes the retention stage </s>
<s> but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place </s>
<s> usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth </s>
<s> susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day </s>
<s> then comes the time when the last wire is removed and susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist </s>
<s> straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months </s>
<s> aligning all the teeth may take a year or more </s>
<s> an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct </s>
<s> the charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country </s>
<s> to become an orthodontist a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist </s>
<s> people today are aware of the value of orthodontics and as a result there are more practitioners in the field </s>
<s> most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years </s>
<s> in many cities in the united states clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee </s>
<s> some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents </s>
<s> research helps families </s>
<s> growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists </s>
<s> this knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment </s>
<s> for example a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another </s>
<s> now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately </s>
<s> in other cases in view of present-day knowledge of head growth orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment </s>
<s> the child is kept on call and the orthodontist watches the growth </s>
<s> superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research </s>
<s> plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used and they save time and money </s>
<s> prevention is best </s>
<s> as a rule the earlier general dental treatment is started the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be </s>
<s> to help prevent orthodontic problems from arising your dentist can do these things </s>
<s> he can correct decay thus preventing early loss of teeth </s>
<s> in turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them </s>
<s> after a while there come initials and names and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames </s>
<s> as the hour progresses the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements </s>
<s> there are a few prognoses of coming events </s>
<s> another medium another sitter would produce a somewhat different content but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading </s>
<s> some mediums speak in practical down-to-earth terms while others may stress the spiritual </s>
<s> however that may be people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons </s>
<s> perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort to feel in touch with the deceased or seek indications for future plans </s>
<s> what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation </s>
<s> but it is not really only a conversation </s>
<s> he himself might not have been really aware of his own mood </s>
<s> however in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium he did not receive a personal reading </s>
<s> instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing </s>
<s> as was noted earlier it is important that in valid objective study of this sort of communication the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive </s>
<s> all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions </s>
<s> in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator nothing else </s>
<s> he gives this to the medium at the appointed time and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator </s>
<s> as always a tape recording or detailed notes are made and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter </s>
<s> now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him </s>
<s> if you look at a reading meant for someone else you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you even when you were not in the picture at all </s>
<s> to get around this quite difficult corner there is one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him </s>
<s> conversely experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following which if they turned out to be hits are so unusual as to be really significant </s>
<s> after being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry </s>
<s> part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road </s>
<s> that is it is known empirically that names beginning with r are more common than those beginning with z </s>
<s> that fewer women are named miranda than elizabeth </s>
<s> that in the united states more people die of heart disease than of smallpox </s>
<s> so each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights </s>
<s> specific dates would be important as would double names </s>
<s> it is very important indeed in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself </s>
<s> that is one thing the experiments are designed to find out </s>
<s> he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his </s>
<s> that is if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him the total experimental score falls </s>
<s> conversely if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others a point is chalked up for the intrinsic objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material </s>
<s> in another approach to the same procedure the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements </s>
<s> mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses </s>
<s> the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors too or subjectively feels emotions </s>
<s> sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective as if the scene were actually there </s>
<s> if pressed by the sitter for more detail she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply almost as if she were physically going closer </s>
<s> perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all </s>
<s> of course there is an element of training here these gifted people by concentration study guidance have learned to develop their power </s>
<s> simply using it increases its intensity i was told by one sensitive </s>
<s> nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery </s>
<s> impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value </s>
<s> it is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious and the medium has to translate these into meaning </s>
<s> during one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons </s>
<s> but this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail </s>
<s> taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement </s>
<s> in this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained </s>
<s> one medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name shietz was significant to the sitter </s>
<s> farming is confining </s>
<s> livestock must be tended every day routinely </s>
<s> a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens </s>
<s> even if there are no livestock the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods particularly during the growing season </s>
<s> the worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily </s>
<s> he cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice </s>
<s> such a move may mean a loss of capital </s>
<s> hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life </s>
<s> the farmer must get up early and at times work late at night </s>
<s> frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain </s>
<s> no matter how well work is planned bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up </s>
<s> it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably </s>
<s> production may fall far below expectations </s>
<s> drought hail disease and insects take their toll of crops </s>
<s> returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year </s>
<s> the high cost of land supplies and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis </s>
<s> land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price higher if it has subdivision possibilities </s>
<s> part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities </s>
<s> if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high farm labor costs will also be high </s>
<s> a part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen per cow or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer </s>
<s> it will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment </s>
<s> he may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations such as spraying or threshing and for these he may have to wait his turn </s>
<s> there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job </s>
<s> the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost </s>
<s> this may be true whether the farm is owned or rented </s>
<s> if the farm is rented the rent must be paid </s>
<s> if it is owned taxes must be paid and if the place is not free of mortgage there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of </s>
<s> advantages </s>
<s> a farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children </s>
<s> it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air </s>
<s> the children can do chores adapted to their age and ability </s>
<s> caring for a calf a pig or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work </s>
<s> part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs </s>
<s> for some retired persons part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income </s>
<s> it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health </s>
<s> generally the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city </s>
<s> the savings are not as great however as is sometime supposed </s>
<s> usually the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more </s>
<s> where schools fire and police protection and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country real estate taxes are usually about the same </s>
<s> a part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably </s>
<s> some persons consider the work on a farm recreational </s>
<s> for some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job and a physical conditioner </s>
<s> land labor and equipment needed </s>
<s> it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation </s>
<s> general requirements for land labor and equipment are discussed below </s>
<s> land </s>
<s> you could not of course raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small </s>
<s> but consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work </s>
<s> the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision </s>
<s> some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development </s>
<s> this is a highly speculative venture </s>
<s> sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract </s>
<s> when surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm </s>
<s> labor </s>
<s> as a rule part-time farmers hire little help </s>
<s> list the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month </s>
<s> you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one </s>
<s> equipment </s>
<s> if you are going to produce for home use only you will need only hand tools </s>
<s> you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing however </s>
<s> these tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing particularly on heavier soils so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing </s>
<s> cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer </s>
<s> if you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises </s>
<s> you can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs </s>
<s> selecting a farm </s>
<s> if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy </s>
<s> discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm </s>
<s> location </s>
<s> nearness to work </s>
<s> choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities </s>
<s> the presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable </s>
<s> obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road </s>
<s> nearness to markets </s>
<s> if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby </s>
<s> if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk for example you should be close to a town or city </s>
<s> kind of neighborhood </s>
<s> look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes </s>
<s> there are slums in the country as well as in the city </s>
<s> few rural areas are protected by zoning </s>
<s> a tavern filling station junk yard rendering plant or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value </s>
<s> facilities in the area </s>
<s> check on the schools in the area the quality of teaching and the provision for transportation to and from them </s>
<s> find out whether fire protection sewage system gas water mains and electrical lines are available in the locality </s>
<s> if these facilities are not at the door getting them may cost more than you expect </s>
<s> you may have to provide them yourself or get along without them </s>
<s> you cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water </s>
<s> if you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled </s>
<s> a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden </s>
<s> pond water can be filtered for human use but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble </s>
<s> the following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses </s>
<s> topography and soil </s>
<s> soil type drainage or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones </s>
<s> the house </s>
<s> if the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed check into the cost of making these improvements </s>
<s> buying a farm </s>
<s> its worth as a place to live </s>
<s> the value of the products you can raise on it </s>
<s> the possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision </s>
<s> decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town </s>
<s> take into account the difference in city and county taxes insurance rates utility rates and the cost of travel to work </s>
<s> next estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm </s>
<s> to do this set up a plan on paper for operating the farm </s>
<s> list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year </s>
<s> estimate the value of the produce at normal prices </s>
<s> the total is the probably gross income from farming </s>
<s> to find estimated net farm income subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming </s>
<s> include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment </s>
<s> also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family </s>
<s> it may be hard to decide what this labor is worth but charge something for it </s>
<s> otherwise you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor </s>
<s> to figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way </s>
<s> everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge </s>
<s> for almost two months the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers graybeards adolescents babies starved beaten to death strangled machine-gunned gassed burned </s>
<s> one who had been a boy in auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers </s>
<s> and still another witness one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot </s>
<s> counsel for the defense however shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections rarely raised an objection </s>
<s> interruptions came largely from the bench which numerous times rebuked the attorney general for letting his witnesses run on though it too made no serious effort to choke off the flow </s>
<s> but there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem and those in moscow and new york </s>
<s> in the united states the initiation of militant anti-communism with the repentant ex-communist in the vanguard </s>
<s> the eichmann case looked to the past not to the future </s>
<s> it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection and of refining the recollection that will last as long as there are jews </s>
<s> it might be contended of course that eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-semitism </s>
<s> but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment </s>
<s> in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument </s>
<s> one who could be linked to anti-semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the jew-baiter throughout the ages </s>
<s> shout at eichmann though he might the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-semitism </s>
<s> but he believed in the jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract theological way like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things </s>
<s> the real question was how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself </s>
<s> in regard to eichmann it was to be found in the nazi outlook which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism a principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself was made more virulent </s>
<s> perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could as eichmann declared feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their murderer </s>
<s> but if the trial did not expose the special nazi mania so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it </s>
<s> the measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry transportation civilian agencies of government </s>
<s> in other words the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the jews was but an extension of the anti-semitic measures already operating in every phase of german life and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective as a readiness for murder </s>
<s> this in fact it turned out to be </s>
<s> whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually </s>
<s> the final solution proved that the jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others </s>
<s> nor did the trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazis both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states </s>
<s> certainly one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon </s>
<s> eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors </s>
<s> the career of eichmann made the trial a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization fearful of being mistaken for a jew he seeks protection in his nazi uniform </s>
<s> clinging to the enemy-jew idea he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness </s>
<s> once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him </s>
<s> the trial should have asked the nations </s>
<s> only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin </s>
<s> it is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to the jews of europe </s>
<s> it is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable </s>
<s> most of the information elicited in jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes tribunals and investigating commissions and by reports memoirs and survivors accounts </s>
<s> three agreed but four declined and were suspended </s>
<s> the peace of the community was badly disturbed and people across the nation reading of the incident felt uneasy </s>
<s> a year later in albany ny a roman catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the planned parenthood association </s>
<s> these incidents typical of many others dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue </s>
<s> it has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies </s>
<s> it has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries </s>
<s> where it is not actually erupting it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano ready to explode at any moment </s>
<s> the time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation </s>
<s> the first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level </s>
<s> instead of emotional recrimination loaded phrases and sloganeering we need a dispassionate study of the facts a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached </s>
<s> all too often our language is unduly harsh </s>
<s> instead of catholics being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring as many non-catholics imagine the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed </s>
<s> family planning is encouraged so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring </s>
<s> this means that such factors as the health of the parents particularly the mother their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring </s>
<s> these are substantially the same factors considered by non-catholics in family planning </s>
<s> the laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons </s>
<s> the roman catholic church however sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning </s>
<s> catholics protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning but disagree over the methods to be used </s>
<s> the roman catholic church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method also known as the use of the infertile or safe period </s>
<s> with the exception of the roman catholic and the orthodox catholic churches most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives allowing the couple free choice </s>
<s> there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement </s>
<s> the latter plays a prominent role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive entirely apart from scripture in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods </s>
<s> the roman catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end </s>
<s> thus man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation the propagation of the race </s>
<s> moreover man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by god who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception </s>
<s> believing that god is the author of this law and of all laws of nature roman catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws not frustrate or mock them </s>
<s> let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between protestants and roman catholics appear to be irreconcilable </s>
<s> but people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines without taking up arms against those who disagree with them </s>
<s> it is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief or at least the practical consequences thereof upon others </s>
<s> it is always a temptation for a religious organization especially a powerful or dominant one to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others </s>
<s> both roman catholics and protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past </s>
<s> many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful </s>
<s> with over four million american men away at war protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public </s>
<s> with the return of our soldiers it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens </s>
<s> the attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers racketeers hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history </s>
<s> that tumultuous painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society </s>
<s> that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today </s>
<s> up to the turn of the century contraception was condemned by all christian churches as immoral unnatural and contrary to divine law </s>
<s> this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian countries </s>
<s> today the roman catholic and orthodox churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction </s>
<s> the various lambeth conferences expressing the anglican viewpoint mirror the gradual change that has taken place among protestants generally </s>
<s> one is the primary purpose for which marriage exists namely the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children </s>
<s> the conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives </s>
<s> many other protestant denominations preceded the anglicans in such action </s>
<s> since then many protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements in which they not only approved birth control but declared it at times to be a religious duty </s>
<s> the board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning </s>
<s> it called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives </s>
<s> an action once universally condemned by all christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant denominations but also deemed at certain times to be a positive religious duty </s>
<s> this viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country </s>
<s> repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control </s>
<s> for all concerned with social-welfare legislation the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american people is clear profound and far-reaching </s>
<s> to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred prohibition experiment </s>
<s> this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation but in the realm of conscience and religion they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief </s>
<s> conscience and religion are concerned with private sin the civil law is concerned with public crimes </s>
<s> only confusion failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin </s>
<s> among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself </s>
<s> she carried besides her captain a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the arctic waters of north america </s>
<s> when she reached port she was found to have on board only eight men all near starvation </s>
<s> the captain was gone and the mate was gone </s>
<s> the man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman </s>
<s> these questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time </s>
<s> all told they offered a highly confused picture </s>
<s> not enough to do away with all doubts but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage </s>
<s> historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations </s>
<s> first they wanted to clarify a tantalizing bizarre enigma </s>
<s> the name henry hudson </s>
<s> twice he had failed and the muscovy company indicated it would not back him again </s>
<s> this time he turned westward to the middle atlantic coast of north america </s>
<s> the government forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship </s>
<s> he thereupon went to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth </s>
<s> by springtime he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of henry prince of wales </s>
<s> he had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one the largest he had ever commanded </s>
<s> the purpose of this fourth voyage was clear </s>
<s> a century of exploration had established that a great land mass north and south america lay between europe and the indies </s>
<s> one by one the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded </s>
<s> but there remained one mysterious unexplored gap far to the north </s>
<s> hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway </s>
<s> even hudson experienced in arctic sailing and determined as he was must have had qualms as he slid down the thames </s>
<s> ahead were perilous ice-filled waters </s>
<s> on previous voyages it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain </s>
<s> on the third voyage a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between dutch and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to amsterdam in mid-atlantic </s>
<s> worse his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before </s>
<s> but men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find </s>
<s> hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer </s>
<s> and he refused to be anything else </s>
<s> it is believed that hudson was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was trained on company ships </s>
<s> he was a londoner married with three sons </s>
<s> he was not the sort of sailor hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had greene wait at gravesend where the discovery picked him up </s>
<s> for the first three weeks the ship skirted up the east coast of great britain then turned westward </s>
<s> the subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome </s>
<s> the issue was settled on shore greene winning and wilson remaining ashore determined to catch the next fishing boat back to england </s>
<s> with difficulty hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship and they sailed from iceland </s>
<s> floating ice bore down from the north and west </s>
<s> fog hung over the route constantly </s>
<s> turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet </s>
<s> as the bergs grew larger hudson was forced to turn south into what is now ungava bay an inlet of the great strait </s>
<s> the great crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason </s>
<s> a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would sail no farther </s>
<s> he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart which he set up in view of the crew </s>
<s> patiently he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives </s>
<s> one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds he would give ninety of them to be back in england </s>
<s> the statement was effective </s>
<s> the meeting broke up </s>
<s> hudson was free to sail on </s>
<s> to starboard was a cape a thousand feet high patched with ice and snow populated by thousands of screaming sea birds </s>
<s> hudson named the capes digges and wolstenholme for two of his backers </s>

<s> the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america </s>
<s> and the emphasis on nationalism in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence across the world </s>
<s> thus if we are to observe american folklore in the twentieth century we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore nationalism and imperialism at the outset </s>
<s> historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence </s>
<s> what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred </s>
<s> its folklore and legend usually disguised as history are allowed to account for group actions to provide a focal point for group loyalty and to become a cohesive force for national identification </s>
<s> one can apply these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine and they can be applied again to the united states in more recent years </s>
<s> the popularity of local color literature before the spanish-american war the steady currency of the lincoln myth the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are cases in point </s>
<s> of course nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century united states </s>
<s> yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian writer or man in the street </s>
<s> it is an understandable paradox that most american history and most american literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion over palm and pine </s>
<s> such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes </s>
<s> in america such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose </s>
<s> a heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land </s>
<s> but we must never forget most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight to answer immediate needs almost always with conscious aims and ends </s>
<s> abraham lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national constitution </s>
<s> robert e lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy </s>
<s> and their roles are paralleled by those of patrick henry nathan hale andrew jackson davy crockett theodore roosevelt and many many more </s>
<s> folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve vary and recreate through oral transmission </s>
<s> it has come to mean myths legends tales songs proverbs riddles superstitions rhymes and such literary forms of expression </s>
<s> related to written literature and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence </s>
<s> though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter </s>
<s> in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this </s>
<s> enthusiastically americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like paul bunyan tales abe lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition </s>
<s> nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material </s>
<s> naturally such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore </s>
<s> that much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant </s>
<s> from all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century american folklore </s>
<s> on the one side we have the university professors and their students trained in teutonic methods of research who have sought out collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic regional and occupational groups that make up this nation </s>
<s> after all the field is large difficult to define and seldom taught properly to american undergraduates </s>
<s> in addition this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly in an age of print and easy communication within an ever-expanding and changing society </s>
<s> the problems confuse even the experts </s>
<s> for that matter the experts themselves are a mixed breed </s>
<s> anthropologists housewives historians and such by profession they approach their discipline as amateurs collectors commercial propagandists analysts or some combination of the four </s>
<s> they have widely varying backgrounds and aims </s>
<s> the outlook for the amateur for instance is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque </s>
<s> folklore is his hobby and he all too rightly wishes it to remain as such </s>
<s> the amateur is closely related to the collector who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field </s>
<s> the collector enjoys the contact with rural life </s>
<s> and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located </s>
<s> both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found </s>
<s> both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines </s>
<s> his standards are of course completely foreign to those of the analyst </s>
<s> to both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications </s>
<s> dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups although he cannot deny his debt to the collector </s>
<s> the knowledge that most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors </s>
<s> the work done by the analysts the men who really know what folklore is all about has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited learned audience </s>
<s> publishers want books that will sell recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music grade and high schools want quaint but moral material </s>
<s> the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in </s>
<s> they see it as a potpourri of charming moral legends and patriotic anecdotes with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there </s>
<s> and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone </s>
<s> if one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant american public </s>
<s> and while every writer must be dealt with as a special case the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each </s>
<s> when he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged </s>
<s> in the first place a good many writers who are said to use folklore do not unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale </s>
<s> robert frost for instance writes about rural life in new england but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems </s>
<s> the last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass </s>
<s> folklore as used by such writers really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it </s>

<s> he was also at this time although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as torrio and capone the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the chicago underworld the roughneck king </s>
<s> the influence of mass was less pervasive than that of the congested slum tenements among the bawdy houses honkytonks and sawdust saloons of his birthplace </s>
<s> he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving police-dodging and housebreaking </s>
<s> at the age of ten when he was working as a newsboy in the loop he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg </s>
<s> he was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman and learning how to shoot to kill from a neanderthal convicted murderer named gene geary later committed to chester asylum as a homicidal maniac but whose eyes misted with tears when the young dion sang a ballad about an irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor </s>

<s> the ancient greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves </s>

<s> tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable </s>
<s> their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest </s>
<s> usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights </s>
<s> not until they sailed home at the end of the day through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses were they aware of what had happened </s>
<s> the giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones </s>
<s> generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers </s>
<s> this is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives </s>
<s> reefs are left high and dry and the beaches are covered with stranded fish </s>
<s> at hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach </s>

<s> the waves may keep coming for many hours </s>
<s> usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest </s>
<s> he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves </s>

<s> the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest </s>
<s> on some of the islands beaches the waves came in gently </s>

<s> scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon </s>
<s> the luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea </s>

<s> it consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface </s>
<s> ordinary water tides are disregarded </s>
<s> this in turn sets off an alarm notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress </s>
<s> such equipment has been installed at hilo midway attu and dutch harbor </s>
<s> the moment the alarm goes off information is immediately forwarded to honolulu which is the center of the warning system </s>
<s> this center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four coast survey stations in the pacific which are equipped with seismographs </s>
<s> its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami </s>
<s> by means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific </s>
<s> the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps </s>
<s> all of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly </s>

<s> the key to the world of geology is change </s>

<s> the land too is changing and earthquakes are daily reminders of this </s>
<s> earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break </s>
<s> sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface </s>
<s> often the shifts cannot be seen but they are there </s>
<s> and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried </s>
<s> the effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized even overemphasized </s>

<s> today a battle cry may seem an anachronism for in the modern army esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables </s>
<s> wiry and burr-headed with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper </s>
<s> the truth is however that when mel chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil </s>
<s> chandler had been commissioned in the medical service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make the army his career he wanted to be in the fighting part of it </s>
<s> though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer he managed to get transferred to the combat forces </s>
<s> in combat helping your co make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed </s>
<s> chandler understood this and expected the worst </s>
<s> but his first few days with troop h were full of surprises beginning with first sergeant robert early </s>
<s> chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice </s>
<s> instead sergeant early was quiet sharp and confident </s>
<s> he had enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade </s>
<s> there was no weapon early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded </s>
<s> he could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work </s>
<s> he not only knew soldiering but mathematics history and literature as well </s>
<s> but for all his erudite confidence sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold </s>
<s> he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh </s>
<s> that saved mel chandler </s>
<s> sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united states army </s>
<s> he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment </s>
<s> but what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it for the good of the troop and the regiment </s>
<s> the final proof was a small incident </s>
<s> in the middle of the party chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him each beaming above the biggest greenest shamrock he had ever seen </s>
<s> the faces belonged to lieutenant marvin goulding his wife and their two children </s>
<s> and when the singing began it was the gouldings who sang the old irish songs the best </s>
<s> though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about marvin goulding the jewish officer from chicago singing tearfully about the ould sod no one really thought it was strange </s>
<s> it was no coincidence that goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment </s>
<s> and so mel chandler got the spirit of garryowen </s>
<s> he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment </s>
<s> even the mess sergeant bill brown a dapper cocky transfer from an airborne division went out on the range </s>
<s> the troop received a new leader lieutenant robert m carroll fresh out of rotc and bucking for regular army status </s>
<s> carroll was sharp and military but he was up against tough competition for that ra berth and he wanted to play it cool </s>
<s> so mel chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of garryowen just as he himself had been sold a short time before </s>
<s> from then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in korea </s>
<s> one night on the naktong river mel chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps </s>
<s> the regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the north koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side </s>
<s> then it came against troop aj </s>
<s> they came in waves </s>
<s> first came the cannon fodder white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram </s>
<s> they were followed by crack north korean troops who mounted one charge after another </s>
<s> another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear </s>
<s> captain chandler saw that it was building up strength </s>
<s> one of the more seriously wounded was lieutenant carroll the young officer bucking for the regular army </s>
<s> chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight </s>
<s> then mel chandler started up the hill </s>
<s> he took one step two broke into a trot and then into a run </s>
<s> burst from his throat </s>
<s> his followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill firing as they ran </s>
<s> the koreans fell back but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire </s>
<s> chandler looking to right and left to see how his men were faring suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran </s>
<s> it was bob carroll who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of garryowen </s>
<s> he had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge </s>
<s> because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again </s>
<s> but an enemy grenade hit carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously </s>
<s> he went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire </s>
<s> enemy reinforcements came pouring down seeking a soft spot </s>
<s> they found it at the junction between troops h and g and prepared to counterattack </s>
<s> marvin goulding saw what was happening </s>
<s> he turned to his platoon </s>
<s> on his lips his men following </s>
<s> but the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and marvin goulding fell dead </s>
<s> for an instant his men hesitated unable to believe that their lieutenant the most popular officer in the regiment was dead </s>
<s> they charged into the enemy like wild men </s>
<s> that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant carroll had begun </s>
<s> the north koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies </s>
<s> artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds </s>
<s> though bob carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade he lived </s>
<s> so filled was mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was over he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment </s>
<s> after years of digging nights and weekends he put together the big profusely illustrated book of garryowen and glory which is probably the most complete history of any military unit </s>
<s> the battle of the naktong river is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off </s>
<s> for nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment </s>
<s> from the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus reno </s>
<s> many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him </s>
<s> but when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him the men who had seen reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the sioux refused to say a harsh word against him </s>

<s> the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity </s>
<s> this is true for two reasons because communism is both doctrinally and in practice antithetical to these conditions </s>
<s> and because communists have the will and as long as soviet power remains intact the capacity to prevent their realization </s>
<s> moreover as communist power increases the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote </s>
<s> it follows that victory over communism is the dominant proximate goal of american policy </s>
<s> but dominant in the sense that every other objective no matter how worthy intrinsically must defer to it </s>
<s> peace is a worthy objective </s>
<s> but if we must choose between peace and keeping the communists out of berlin then we must fight </s>
<s> freedom in the sense of self-determination is a worthy objective </s>
<s> but if granting self-determination to the algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the sino-soviet orbit then algerian freedom must be postponed </s>
<s> justice is a worthy objective </s>
<s> but if justice for bantus entails driving the government of the union of south africa away from the west then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer </s>
<s> prosperity is a worthy objective </s>

<s> the uses of power </s>
<s> this brings us squarely to the problem of power and the uses a nation makes of power </s>
<s> i submit that this is the key problem of international relations that it always has been that it always will be </s>
<s> in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power and i think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus </s>
<s> one was demonstrably false </s>
<s> the other for the most part true </s>
<s> i know i do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention </s>
<s> i have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those americans who have doubts and i think mr jameson campaigne has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth </s>
<s> overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast </s>
<s> add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity </s>
<s> add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength </s>
<s> the contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign but once that has been done i fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it </s>
<s> prestige however is only a minor part of the problem </s>
<s> and even then it is a concept that can be highly misleading </s>
<s> prestige is a measure of how other people think of you well or ill </s>
<s> but contrary to what was implied during the campaign prestige is surely not important for its own sake </s>
<s> only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be </s>
<s> the thing to lose sleep over is what people having concluded that we are weaker than we are are likely to do about it </s>
<s> the evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the united states is weaker than the soviet union and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead </s>
<s> this ignorant estimate i repeat is not of any interest in itself </s>
<s> to the extent then that declining us prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation there is reason for concern </s>
<s> still these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves </s>
<s> communist gains </s>
<s> success may mean merely the displacement of western influence </s>
<s> communist political warfare we must remember is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages </s>
<s> the soviets understand moreover that the first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against the west </s>
<s> and this may be as far as the process will go </s>
<s> to recite the particulars of recent soviet successes is hardly reassuring </s>
<s> six years ago french indochina though in troubie was in the western camp </s>
<s> today northern vietnam is overtly communist </s>
<s> laos is teetering between communism and pro-communist neutralism </s>
<s> cambodia is for all practical purposes neutralist </s>
<s> indonesia in the early days of the republic leaned toward the west </s>
<s> ceylon has moved from a pro-western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the west </s>
<s> in the middle east iraq syria and egypt were a short while ago in the western camp </s>
<s> today the nasser and kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the west are dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel </s>
<s> a short time ago all africa was a western preserve </s>
<s> never mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoyed wilsonian self-determination the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west </s>
<s> today africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging it would seem into the soviet orbit </s>
<s> today it is up for grabs </s>
<s> one latin american country cuba has become a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast </s>
<s> the strains of neutralism are running strong notably in england and even in germany </s>
<s> opportunities missed </s>

<s> there was the polish revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to soviet interests </s>
<s> there was the revolution in tibet which we pretended did not exist </s>
<s> only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing communist power in guatemala </s>
<s> we served our national interests and by so doing we saved the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery </s>

<s> gunfire saves the moon </s>
<s> there had been an eclipse of the moon </s>
<s> a traditional lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad and the remedy was to make all possible noise ideally with firearms </s>
<s> the din was successful too for just before the moon disappeared the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again which meant good luck all around </s>
<s> how quaint it all seemed the next day </s>
<s> but everyone i met had sought cover first and asked questions later </s>
<s> and no wonder for vientiane the old city of sandalwood had become the city of bullet holes </s>
<s> i saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets </s>
<s> along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered </s>

<s> prime minister moves fast </s>
<s> alas so it almost proved for us too </s>
<s> to go outside the few cities required permits </s>
<s> nobody wanted americans to be hurt or captured and few soldiers could be spared as escorts </s>
<s> everyone had heard of the american contractor who had spurned an escort </s>
<s> now pathet lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village as evidence of evil american intervention </s>
<s> although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in vientiane with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in french we were getting nowhere </s>
<s> we had nearly decided that all the tales of lao lethargy must be true when we were invited to take a trip with the prime minister </s>
<s> his highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town and he was eager to be off </s>
<s> prince wears ten-gallon hat </s>
<s> and so after a flight southeast to savannakhet we found ourselves bouncing along in a jeep right behind the land-rover of prince boun oum of champassak a tall man of churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from texas </s>
<s> from his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a luger </s>
<s> with our company of soldiers we made one long column of reddish dust </s>
<s> in keng kok the city of silkworms the prime minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas and two notebooks for me </s>
<s> then we drove on until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields bouncing across their squat earth walls </s>
<s> it was a spleen-crushing day </s>
<s> an hour of bouncing a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary </s>
<s> more bouncing another stop a new house for teachers a new well </s>
<s> then off again rushing to keep up </s>
<s> we were miserable </s>
<s> mr keo once a diplomat in paris and washington was commissioner of rural affairs </s>

<s> mr keo agreed </s>
<s> now they learn that men can change their surroundings through their traditional village elders without violence </s>

<s> then came coconuts eggs and rice wine </s>
<s> the prime minister paid his respects to the buddhist monks strode rapidly among the houses joked with the local soldiery and made a speech </s>
<s> the soldiers are fighting and the americans are helping he said but in the fight against the pathet lao the key factor is the villager himself </s>
<s> then we were off again </s>
<s> we did it for three days </s>
<s> then we hung overboard in the water </s>
<s> briefly we rolled over a paved road up to pak song on the cool bolovens plateau </s>
<s> the prince visited the hospital of operation brotherhood supported by the junior chamber of commerce of the philippines and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at pak song </s>
<s> strings keep souls in place </s>
<s> this is the most endearing of lao ceremonies </s>
<s> the preparations were elaborate flowers candles incense sticks rice wine dozens of delicacies and pieces of white cotton string </s>
<s> the candles were lighted and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables </s>
<s> now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us </s>
<s> next he addressed himself to our souls </s>
<s> those souls like to wander off and must be called back </s>
<s> with the divinities present and our souls in place we were wished health happiness and power </s>
<s> then one after another the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists </s>
<s> as we stepped out into the sunlight a man came up to john cool and silently showed him his hand </s>
<s> it had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar </s>
<s> we could see maggots moving </s>
<s> my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds </s>
<s> jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings </s>
<s> when i pressed for a purely religious definition i encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety interfaith good will and a small residue of ethnic loyalty </s>
<s> you can communicate in your own way </s>
<s> this accords with the study by maier and spinrad </s>
<s> nevertheless most of the teen-agers i interviewed believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple </s>
<s> the reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers minds </s>
<s> intermarriage which is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild clinical disapproval </s>
<s> most of the teen-agers i interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds </s>
<s> it appears that an orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would not travel on saturday and in addition required kosher food </s>
<s> this is no doubt inaccurate but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant </s>
<s> the older teens </s>
<s> one of the significant things about jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented </s>
<s> sixty-five per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning </s>
<s> this may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town jewish boy </s>
<s> in their first two years in high school jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams </s>
<s> however in their junior and senior years they generally forego their athletic pursuits presumably in the interest of better academic achievement </s>
<s> it is significant too that the older teen-agers i interviewed believed unlike the younger ones that jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts </s>
<s> the percentage of jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys </s>
<s> the motivations for both sexes to be sure are different </s>
<s> the vocational motive is the dominant one for boys while jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed </s>
<s> one of the significant developments in american-jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women </s>
<s> in upper teen jewish life the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality </s>
<s> however among the girls there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college </s>
<s> she is even prone to regard the college girl as immature </s>
<s> the lower-middle class college student </s>
<s> one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost </s>
<s> this is particularly true in large centers of jewish population like new york chicago and philadelphia </s>
<s> what is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-jewish world </s>
<s> there is to begin an important sex difference </s>
<s> typically in a lower-middle class jewish family a son will be sent to an out-of-town school if financial resources warrant it while the daughter will attend the local college </s>
<s> there are two reasons for this </s>
<s> second the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son </s>
<s> most jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home </s>
<s> the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn college outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically </s>
<s> one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town </s>
<s> brooklyn college students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school </s>
<s> on the one hand there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school </s>
<s> this is particularly acute for those who attended midwood high school directly across the street from brooklyn college </s>
<s> they have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status the out-of-town school </s>
<s> for most brooklyn college students college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family </s>
<s> brooklyn college is unequivocally jewish in tone and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing </s>
<s> however a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents </s>
<s> and the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but rather a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping </s>
<s> for girls the overprotection is far more pervasive </s>
<s> parents will drive on friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or house plan meeting </s>
<s> the domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field </s>
<s> this means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature </s>
<s> a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex </s>
<s> the breaking away from the prison house of brooklyn is gradual </s>
<s> first the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights </s>
<s> then with the new affluence there is actually a sallying forth into the wide wide world beyond the precincts of new york </s>
<s> the great world beyond beckons </s>
<s> although brooklyn college does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program a good number of students spend summers in europe </s>
<s> in general however the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at harvard or smith </s>
<s> and acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after college rather than during the four school years </s>
<s> brooklyn college is marjorie morningstar territory as much as the bronx or central park west </s>
<s> there are hordes of nubile young women there who prodded by their impatient mothers are determined to marry </s>
<s> these announcements are in effect advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts </s>
<s> there are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings pinnings ringings engagements and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity </s>
<s> the brooklyn college student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models </s>
<s> the ivy league enjoys no easy dominion here and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish continental fashion or even in nondescript working class manner as they are in the restrained button-down ivy way </s>
<s> among the boys there is very little bravado about drinking </s>
<s> brooklyn college is distinctive for not having an official drinking place </s>
<s> the fort lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college boys </s>
<s> for galled breasts the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste </s>
<s> this could also be used for any other skin irritation </s>
<s> or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts </s>
<s> at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection one for hastening delayed menstruation </s>
<s> the sufferer drinks tansy tea </s>
<s> bruises burns cuts etc occurred frequently on the frontier and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too </s>
<s> bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak </s>
<s> many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water </s>
<s> the burn oozed watery fluid for many days and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts </s>
<s> another swore by vinegar baths for burns and still another recommended salted butter </s>
<s> this was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil </s>
<s> when it was cool the fat was skimmed off and bottled </s>
<s> one man badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time </s>
<s> later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns </s>
<s> the results were good but which treatment helped is still not known </s>
<s> to stop bleeding cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds </s>
<s> one old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut even when on a knuckle if it was made by a rusty tool </s>
<s> this would stop the flow and also prevent infection </s>
<s> my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds </s>
<s> she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth over which she poured turpentine </s>
<s> he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated </s>
<s> there is scarcely a scar showing </s>
<s> tobacco was common first aid </s>
<s> or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing </s>
<s> one old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head </s>
<s> his brother ran a mile to get the father </s>
<s> when they reached the boy the father sliced a new plug of tobacco put the scalp back in place and covered the raw edges with the slices </s>
<s> then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place </s>
<s> there was no cleaning or further care but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar </s>
<s> veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding and rue was an antiseptic </s>
<s> they would feed on its surface leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated </s>
<s> tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound </s>
<s> one family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips or if these were not handy plain lard </s>
<s> another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke </s>
<s> another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker </s>
<s> while nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose not long ago a nosebleed was simply that and treatment had little variation </s>
<s> since a fall or blow might have caused it a cold pack was usually first aid </s>
<s> or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears </s>
<s> old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water </s>
<s> blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance </s>
<s> felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven pounding it fine and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine </s>
<s> this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part </s>
<s> insect bites were cured in many ways </s>
<s> many an old-timer swore by the saliva method </s>
<s> this was used also for bruises </s>
<s> yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings </s>
<s> chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived </s>
<s> bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests </s>
<s> ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing </s>
<s> for mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made </s>
<s> for wasp stings onion juice obtained by scraping an onion gave quick relief </s>
<s> a handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water </s>
<s> mud was sometimes used as well as soap </s>
<s> just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings </s>
<s> bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days </s>
<s> bed slats were washed in alum water legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate applied with a feather </s>
<s> kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests </s>
<s> at times pioneer children got lice in their hair </s>
<s> a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment but it did the job </s>
<s> a cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye </s>
<s> as the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out </s>
<s> another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed </s>
<s> the particle would then move toward the nose where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton </s>
<s> shingles were cured by gentian an old drug used in combinations </s>
<s> for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth </s>
<s> winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped </s>
<s> to cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water </s>
<s> they drank half a cup of this morning and night and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution </s>
<s> six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies </s>
<s> frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow </s>
<s> now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead </s>
<s> another remedy was oil of eucalyptus used as well for chilblains </s>
<s> chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves </s>
<s> boils have always been a source of much trouble </s>
<s> a german informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice </s>
<s> another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree steeped in water until it formed a sticky gummy solution </s>
<s> this was also used for sores </s>
<s> another frequent pioneer difficulty caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots was corns </s>
<s> another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight </s>
<s> this softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on </s>
<s> there were many cures for warts </s>
<s> one young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times </s>
<s> another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days </s>
<s> wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments and strangely enough many warts did just that </s>
<s> one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy </s>
<s> another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours tie it on the wart and wear it for a week </s>
<s> a simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way </s>
<s> i know this worked </s>
<s> one person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water </s>
<s> another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily </s>
<s> another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment </s>
<s> the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave </s>
<s> as the onion decayed so did the wart </s>
<s> sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub </s>
<s> leg cramps one person tells me were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard </s>
<s> this does give relief as i can testify </s>
<s> one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps </s>
<s> for sprains and swellings one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief </s>
<s> in instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity the situation is ideal </s>
<s> it may on occasion be anything but that </s>
<s> a good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards or the best parts of them </s>
<s> these are the wines the french themselves use for everyday drinking for even in france virtually no one drinks the grands crus on a meal-to-meal basis </s>
<s> the grands crus are expensive and even doting palates tire of them </s>
<s> and certainly in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the grands crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown </s>
<s> there is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper </s>
<s> wine waiters are something else again </s>
<s> especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal their importance mounts </s>
<s> most of them the world over operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and some other latin countries the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise with the burden of proof on the customer himself </s>
<s> this is the only valid and extenuating argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter </s>
<s> faced on the one hand with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence </s>
<s> only then perhaps will he reveal his jewels and his bargains </s>
<s> wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served </s>
<s> this is especially true of red wines and a practice which though not always practicable is well worth the effort </s>
<s> it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days but in terms of months and years it is fatal </s>
<s> wine stored for a long time should be on its side </s>
<s> otherwise the cork dries and air enters to spoil it </s>
<s> when stacking wine on its side in a bin care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork </s>
<s> fat bottles such as burgundies have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood to hold them in the proper reclining posture </s>
<s> too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks again with ill effects </s>
<s> if it smells of cork one has grounds for suspicion </s>
<s> seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine they age it prematurely </s>
<s> the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this provided there are no sudden or frequent changes </s>
<s> prolonged vibration is also undesirable </s>
<s> light especially daylight is always bad for wine </s>
<s> all in all though there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking </s>
<s> many people go to extreme lengths in decanting chilling or warming or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork </s>
<s> no one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this and to give fair warning where warning is due no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism </s>
<s> but the fact remains that in most restaurants including some of the best of paris and bordeaux and dijon the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal </s>
<s> for those who live in a winter climate there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow </s>
<s> though by no means an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time </s>
<s> it may be a bit cold when poured </s>
<s> but again as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt wine should be served in a large tulip-shaped glass which is never filled more than half full </s>
<s> the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire </s>
<s> very old red wines often require several hours of aeration and any red wine brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime should be uncorked and allowed some air </s>
<s> but white wines never </s>
<s> white wines should be opened when served having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness </s>
<s> thus sauternes or barsacs should be very cold </s>
<s> a pouilly-fuisse or a chablis somewhat less cold </s>
<s> the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air </s>
<s> if this must be done they should always be corked and kept in a cool place </s>
<s> it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk </s>
<s> a few red wines notably those of the beaujolais are better consumed at cellar temperature </s>
<s> thus red wine must if possible never be disturbed or shaken </s>
<s> very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself </s>
<s> a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea </s>
<s> the cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward </s>

<s> dartmouth is numerically still a small college today with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates </s>

<s> only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation </s>
<s> about two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools </s>
<s> it is still a college only and not a university </s>
<s> it is in fact the only college in the ivy group </s>
<s> all three are purposely kept small with a current total enrollment of about two hundred </s>
<s> all three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and like the college proper place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study </s>

<s> lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door even though it was a very hot day </s>
<s> it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her uncle morse </s>
<s> at that time jennings had a young law associate named arthur s phillips </s>
<s> a few years ago not too long before his death phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected morse of the murders </s>
<s> he said morse and borden had quarreled violently in the house that day information which must have come from lizzie </s>
<s> it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door </s>

<s> it is known that morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at westport a town not far from fall river </s>
<s> they were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters </s>
<s> fall river police did go to westport to see if they could get any information against morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men </s>
<s> these officers found no incriminating information </s>
<s> the woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner </s>
<s> fall river is not a fashionable town </s>
<s> the dinner hour there was twelve noon </s>
<s> they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar morse said he had taken but the man did not remember morse as a passenger </s>

<s> morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door </s>
<s> from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying more than a mile away </s>
<s> he met nobody he knew on this walk </s>
<s> there is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs borden was killed </s>
<s> she said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that mrs borden told her to wash the windows </s>
<s> this was long after morse had left the house </s>
<s> he knew the house fairly well he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone </s>
<s> the screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back </s>
<s> it was unlocked all the time she was washing windows </s>
<s> morse could have returned openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied </s>
<s> mrs borden would not have been alarmed if she saw morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand </s>
<s> he had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm </s>
<s> mrs borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out </s>
<s> he could have left for weybosset street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar </s>
<s> with lizzie in the barn the screen door unlocked and bridget upstairs in her attic room he would have had free and easy access to the house </s>
<s> with the second murder over he could have left hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood </s>
<s> his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree with crowds already gathering in front of the building and sawyer guarding the side door was odd </s>
<s> there was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains and certainly no scientific test was made of them </s>
<s> and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed </s>
<s> the motive may have been the mysterious quarrel </s>
<s> there was no financial gain for morse in the murders </s>
<s> on the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying </s>
<s> the time would have been shortly after the murder of mrs borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior </s>
<s> he said he had promised mrs borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden house </s>
<s> he wrote </s>
<s> neither had any interest in the deaths </s>
<s> that was his complete discussion of bridget sullivan as a possible suspect </s>
<s> although pearson disbelieved almost everything lizzie said and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did he happily accepted her statement about bridget as the whole truth </s>
<s> he felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl </s>
<s> lizzie actually never named any suspect </s>
<s> she told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner </s>
<s> and much as she detested hiram harrington she also did not accuse him </s>

<s> kirby was of course reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders </s>
<s> everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that as far as we know there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders lizzie borden and bridget sullivan </s>

<s> true it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations </s>

<s> there are also other factors that require closer examination </s>
<s> the people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points always to the detriment of lizzie </s>
<s> if bridget did get any bundles of cash the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been lizzie borden </s>
<s> bridget was born in ireland one of fourteen children </s>

<s> in general however it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next </s>
<s> if the student drops out of high school the break with the school is even more complete </s>
<s> indeed in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work </s>
<s> statistically this has represented a loss to the nation although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one </s>
<s> i make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered </s>
<s> but in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent </s>
<s> in a later chapter dealing with the suburban school i shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found </s>
<s> in the negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation </s>
<s> undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the negro schools </s>
<s> however the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual </s>
<s> and the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership </s>
<s> this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern universities </s>
<s> quite the contrary as i can testify from personal experience as a former university president </s>
<s> rather we see here another vicious circle </s>
<s> the absence of successful negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic careers </s>
<s> i believe the situation is improving but the success stories need to be heavily publicized </s>
<s> here again we run into the roadblock that negroes do not like to be designated as negroes in the press </s>
<s> this is a problem to which leaders of opinion both negro and white should devote far more attention </s>
<s> it is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the south </s>
<s> vocational education </s>
<s> i should like to underline four points i made in my first report with respect to vocational education </s>
<s> first and foremost vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation </s>
<s> however for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier </s>
<s> third the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work </s>
<s> they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time </s>
<s> fourth the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality </s>
<s> this last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few if any graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training the whole idea of relevance disappears </s>
<s> those who because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience </s>
<s> i intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls </s>
<s> practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill </s>
<s> they are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school </s>
<s> to be sure in tool-and-die work and in the building trades the first job must be often on an apprentice basis but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status </s>
<s> similarly a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school </s>
<s> of course it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill </s>
<s> so too is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics </s>
<s> in spite of the shading of one type of course into another i believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses </s>
<s> perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule </s>
<s> today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school </s>
<s> most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools </s>
<s> in this respect public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts </s>
<s> the neighborhood high schools are not strictly speaking comprehensive schools because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school </s>
<s> indeed one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs </s>
<s> the suburban high school it is worth noting also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs </s>
<s> the reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community </s>
<s> therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report </s>
<s> the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions </s>
<s> by and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system </s>
<s> it is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment except for a lucky few </s>
<s> it is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation </s>
<s> two stories will illustrate what i have in mind </s>
<s> one vocational instructor in a city vocational school speaking of his course in a certain field said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city </s>
<s> in a far distant part of the united states i was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> in my view there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city </s>
<s> ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest </s>
<s> an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the dunbar vocational high school in chicago </s>
<s> located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students </s>
<s> i discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were negroes </s>
<s> they were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing bricklaying carpentry cabinet making auto mechanics and airplane mechanics </s>

<s> it was john who found the lion tracks </s>
<s> he found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before and he circled once nose to the ground hair shooting up along his back as it did when he was after lion or bear and then he lifted his head and bayed and the pack joined in all heads high and jones knew it was a hot trail </s>
<s> he stifled the comanche yell and let john lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain </s>
<s> this mountain was known as the black reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet honeycombed with caves top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass </s>
<s> on the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly </s>
<s> kearton and ulyate had started the day together while jones followed the dogs and means and loveless had taken another route and now with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him ulyate reined in in the shadow of the reef and pointed </s>
<s> kearton focussed his field glasses </s>
<s> as they watched jones rode straight for the reef </s>
<s> then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him </s>
<s> the pack had made a bend to the north swinging back toward the reef and kearton and ulyate could hear them faintly </s>
<s> kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring loveless and means and the rest of the party </s>
<s> jones came toward them fast now along the southern toe of the reef and the dogs could be heard plainly old john with his grand canyon voice outstanding above the others </s>
<s> there was sounder too also a veteran of the north rim and rastus and the rake from a pack of english fox-hounds and a collie from a london pound and simba a terrier </s>
<s> a motley pack chosen for effectiveness not beauty </s>
<s> jones was galloping close behind them leaning down cheering them on </s>
<s> ulyate said and kearton touched a match to the pile of grass blew on it and flame licked out </s>
<s> he threw green stuff on it and a thin blue column of smoke rose </s>
<s> two quick shots sounded </s>
<s> then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying </s>
<s> then the heavy roar of a lion </s>
<s> kearton and ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound </s>
<s> it came from the top of the reef not half a mile away </s>
<s> at the base of the rocky hillside they left their horses and climbed on foot </s>
<s> the route was choked with rugged lava-rocks creepers and bushes so thickly overgrown that when kearton lost sight of ulyate and called ulyate answered from ten feet away </s>
<s> nice country to meet a lion in face to face </s>
<s> jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the reef </s>
<s> intuition told him however that she was tired and winded from the run up the reef and would not charge yet </s>
<s> he moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her being careful because he knew the female is less predictable than the male </s>
<s> of the thirty-four seventeen had been killed by lions and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses </s>
<s> he threw the lasso </s>
<s> it was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock </s>
<s> even then if she took one step forward he could catch her </s>
<s> jones then recoiled his rope and threw again this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her </s>
<s> while jones on the other hand appeared perfectly confident and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer </s>
<s> from the lioness point of view this strange creature on the back of another creature lashing out with its long thin paw very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with </s>
<s> but now she sank lower to the rock </s>
<s> her roar changed to a growl </s>
<s> her tail no longer lashed </s>
<s> although she appeared more subdued and defeated jones knew she was growing more dangerous </s>
<s> she was rested and could mount a charge </s>
<s> just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet </s>
<s> at this moment loveless and means arrived crashing through the undergrowth with their horses and distracted her and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks </s>
<s> the dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded old john </s>
<s> for such an emergency he had included fourth-of-july cannon crackers as part of their equipment </s>
<s> lighting one he pitched it into the crevice and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed </s>
<s> called out means as she ran </s>
<s> for two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the reef trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw </s>
<s> but she clung to the rocks and brush and the day wore away </s>
<s> it was hot </s>
<s> the dogs were tired </s>
<s> the men were tired too </s>
<s> it was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again </s>
<s> and the sun was beginning to go down </s>
<s> if dark came they would lose her </s>
<s> at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the reef </s>
<s> ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions heads with poles and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago not the gentler ones of today and this one was angry with good reason </s>
<s> loveless too objected </s>
<s> but without waiting for them to try it she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain </s>
<s> john led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind many of them trailing blood </s>
<s> john himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail but he was in this fight to the finish running almost as strongly now as in the morning </s>
<s> she took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully crouched at the base of a thorn tree and waited for them to come up </s>
<s> she had chosen the spot well </s>
<s> with the gully on three sides she could be approached only along the tongue of land </s>
<s> means tried her first </s>
<s> very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding edging closer watching for a chance to throw but ready to spin and run rope whining about his head horse edging tensely under him but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion </s>
<s> means edged closer </s>
<s> she snarled warningly </s>
<s> means spit and edged on </s>
<s> again she snarled and again he edged </s>
<s> the pony was sidewise to her </s>
<s> with a whirling jump it could get into gear </s>
<s> however nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance unless it was a cheetah </s>
<s> she charged </s>
<s> means spun and spurred </s>
<s> for thirty yards she gained rapidly </s>
<s> means held steady one jump ahead of her </s>
<s> then gradually he began to pull away </s>
<s> a western cowpony had outrun an african lion from a standing start </s>
<s> of course the factor of head start made all the difference </s>
<s> no one knew exactly </s>
<s> that was the whole question </s>
<s> enough was the answer </s>
<s> as she had done with means she gained rapidly at first but then baldy began to draw away </s>
<s> somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point </s>
<s> when jones too drew away she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully crouched low and waited as before </s>
<s> this new position however gave the ropers a better chance </s>
<s> there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went </s>
<s> so means edged around on the north side of her jones moved in from the south </s>
<s> tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention </s>
<s> from behind her means shot forward at a run </s>
<s> but means kept on </s>
<s> he raced by within twenty feet of her roped her around the neck but a lioness neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off </s>
<s> the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies </s>
<s> but the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life </s>
<s> the christian education of children too was once hardly more than a sideshow but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty </s>
<s> the most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives </s>
<s> most pastors and laymen even though they believe it to be important assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes </s>
<s> as long as this point of view prevails the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt </s>
<s> the next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community </s>
<s> the front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side </s>
<s> until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes programs and relationships it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality </s>
<s> as things now stand there is a grievous disparity between the unity in christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any main street in the nation </s>
<s> the ecumenical congregation </s>
<s> the crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community </s>
<s> the decisive question is what happens within each congregation and finally in the minds and hearts of the individual members </s>
<s> it is here that the local and ecumenical must meet </s>
<s> it is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical </s>
<s> this way of describing the matter is unfortunate </s>
<s> it implies two misconceptions </s>
<s> the truth however is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god throughout the world </s>
<s> the other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections now comprehended by many national leaders can be communicated to all congregations </s>
<s> however needed this may be the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ in the world </s>
<s> the basic unit in the church of whatever denominational polity is always the congregation </s>
<s> it is hardly possible to emphasize this too much </s>
<s> most people do not realize that the congregation as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another is unique </s>
<s> the idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken </s>
<s> the jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the christian congregation but hinduism buddhism islam confucianism taoism shintoism although they have sacred scriptures priests spiritual disciplines and places of prayer do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love </s>
<s> their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship </s>
<s> how far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the new testament means by koinonia </s>
<s> what is now called christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes </s>
<s> the koinonia of acts and of the epistles means sharing in a common relation to christ </s>
<s> it is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of christ in his people </s>
<s> this may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom on the level of merely human agreeableness we might prefer not to have any association at all </s>
<s> there is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the new testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building </s>
<s> whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal church in vital relation with the whole body of christ and participating in his mission to the world a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid </s>
<s> the antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists </s>
<s> the local and the ecumenical are one </s>
<s> of course the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the people of god will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place </s>
<s> each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other </s>
<s> neither is adequate if it stands alone </s>
<s> our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other </s>
<s> and this is what all too often happens </s>
<s> divergent perspectives </s>
<s> a little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by professor bela vasady at the end of the second world war </s>
<s> with great difficulty he made his way from his native hungary to geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the provisional committee for the world council of churches </s>
<s> when he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones </s>
<s> they were bifocals </s>
<s> it is he said a bifocal vision which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a christian in right relation to both </s>
<s> as things stand now the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other </s>
<s> on the one hand there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town </s>
<s> they do not escape the pitfall into which charles dickens pictured mrs jellyby as falling </s>
<s> her concern for the natives of borrioboola-gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son peepy </s>
<s> likewise the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in east germany the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary china and the anguish of the church over apartheid in south africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship pastoral service and counseling and christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals </s>
<s> on the other hand many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission </s>
<s> as a result they go on thinking of the church with introverted and self-centered satisfaction only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families </s>
<s> the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world </s>
<s> the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs </s>
<s> it is eminently successful according to all conventional standards </s>
<s> it is growing in numbers </s>
<s> its people are agreeable friends </s>
<s> it has a beautiful edifice </s>
<s> its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain </s>
<s> it provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled </s>
<s> it helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the bible </s>
<s> it draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation </s>
<s> and it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is </s>
<s> all too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind </s>
<s> it is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of christ </s>
<s> it is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy </s>
<s> it is not making them sensitive to the sub-christian level of much of our economic and industrial life </s>
<s> it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples </s>
<s> it is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in asia and africa </s>
<s> to put it bluntly many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want </s>
<s> it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility in relation to the world </s>
<s> we shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness and mission to the world </s>

<s> the adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs time diffusion </s>
<s> experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately </s>
<s> these polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters </s>
<s> some of these mothers apparently feeling a desperate urgency made on the spur of the moment commitments in love and sex that would have life-long consequences </s>

<s> for many of these unwed mothers the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general </s>

<s> however if the child has been constantly surrounded during nursery and early school age by peer groups </s>

<s> her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations in her adolescence of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame if not guilt for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to and judged by the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends </s>
<s> to be different is to invite shame and doubt </s>
<s> many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others </s>
<s> another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs work-paralysis </s>
<s> these childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs for experimenting with many roles and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities </s>
<s> whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school </s>
<s> whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school </s>
<s> and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study </s>

<s> they attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made </s>
<s> they accepted a job primarily because it was available convenient and paid reasonably </s>
<s> these things both express and at the same time continue contributing to their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty </s>
<s> as their identity diffusion increased they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs </s>
<s> these affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship no sense of dignity derived from a job well done </s>
<s> childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy </s>
<s> the excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance though through different facets of experience </s>
<s> for example some unwed mothers had had no work experiences household chores and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence </s>
<s> they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting </s>
<s> sex was both </s>
<s> the adolescent also faces the identity crisis that erikson has termed ideological polarization vs diffusion of ideals </s>
<s> this tendency is perhaps most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents </s>
<s> the positive development during adolescence of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas values and practices depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy initiative and self-certainty </s>
<s> most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values </s>
<s> the diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed however in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty </s>
<s> it is mirrored by the individual willie lohmans whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment </s>
<s> they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse </s>

<s> yet the huge amount of money consumed by the selden litigation which many regarded as wasteful indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure </s>
<s> the duration and other circumstances of the selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions </s>
<s> the suit as we have seen came before the courts when patent attorneys inventors and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the american patent system </s>
<s> chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity </s>
<s> in a long and angry footnote to his opinion judge hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism </s>
<s> he cited the elephantine dimensions of the selden case record </s>
<s> the duplication of testimony and exhibits </s>
<s> the numerous squabbles over minor matters </s>
<s> not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the selden suit </s>
<s> william a redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years </s>
<s> its costive deliberations were likened to those of the british courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by dickens in bleak house </s>
<s> parker who agreed with much of this criticism did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects </s>
<s> but he felt that the selden case was being unfairly pilloried </s>
<s> the suit although commonly designated as a single action actually embraced five cases </s>
<s> parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony </s>
<s> parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony </s>
<s> parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony </s>
<s> the taking of depositions he suggested should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony </s>
<s> the revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform </s>
<s> under the new rules testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character </s>
<s> other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity limit delays and reduce the expense of infringement suits </s>
<s> while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money </s>
<s> there is little doubt that they were promulgated by the supreme court as a direct result of the selden patent suit </s>
<s> the trade bodies which came in the wake of the alam were more representative for they never adopted a policy of exclusion </s>
<s> nevertheless it is from the selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade </s>
<s> one of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement a milestone in the development of american industrial cooperation </s>
<s> its origin lies in the selden patent controversy and its aftermath </s>
<s> from the earliest days of the motor car industry before the alam was established patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem </s>
<s> many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories among them tires detachable rims ball bearings license brackets and electric horns </s>
<s> the fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims </s>
<s> in this tangle of conflicting claims the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the alam at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation </s>
<s> one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among alam members </s>
<s> within its limits this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement </s>
<s> its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly </s>
<s> since the alam holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry </s>
<s> the highly important dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the alam pool </s>
<s> it was commonplace for auto makers parts-suppliers and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail </s>
<s> occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications </s>
<s> by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information </s>
<s> at this point charles c hanch long an advocate of patent peace in the industry became chairman of the patents committee of the national automobile chamber of commerce successor to the automobile board of trade </s>
<s> the breach created by the selden patent doomed his proposal but hanch did not abandon his scheme </s>
<s> after the demise of the alam the time was propitious for establishing such a pool </s>
<s> most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents </s>
<s> the plan was supported by frederick p fish counsel for the national automobile chamber of commerce </s>
<s> it will be recalled that in his summation for the alam before judge hough fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the american industrial community </s>
<s> he was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value </s>
<s> the eloquent persuasions of fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association </s>

<s> almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time </s>
<s> it was porter however who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued </s>
<s> the movie was the great train robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable </s>
<s> the great train robbery is a one-reel film </s>
<s> the reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies </s>
<s> the material of the porter film is simplicity itself </s>
<s> a band of robbers enters a railroad station overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator holds up the train and escapes </s>
<s> a posse is formed and pursues the robbers who having made their escape are whooping it up with some wild wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out </s>
<s> the robbers run from the hide-out take cover in a wooded declivity and are shot dead by the posse </s>
<s> as a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience </s>
<s> all this is simple enough but in telling the story porter did two important things that had not been done before </s>
<s> the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen </s>
<s> if the change at first sight seems minor we may recall that it took the italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change and the italian painters by universal consent were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen </s>
<s> in that apparently simple shift porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device </s>
<s> he did more than that </s>
<s> cutting of course takes place automatically in the creation of a film </s>
<s> the meaning of the word is quite physical to begin with </s>
<s> the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence and the cut edge is joined physically by cement to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence </s>
<s> if as a home movie maker you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps you have merely recorded an historical event </s>
<s> you are employing the basic technique of film </s>
<s> you are cutting </s>
<s> this is what porter did </s>
<s> she dashes around in alarm </s>
<s> the two events are taking place at the same time </s>
<s> time and space have both become cinematic </s>
<s> the chase in itself is a narrative </s>
<s> the simple naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction </s>
<s> the cowboy films the cops and robbers films and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence </s>
<s> the creator of the art of the film dw griffith </s>
<s> there still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art </s>
<s> the man was dw griffith </s>
<s> in about seven years griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker </s>
<s> before he was forty griffith had created the art of the film </s>
<s> not that there had not been attempts mostly european to do exactly that </s>
<s> but in general the european efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself </s>
<s> staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented </s>
<s> in all of this extensive and expensive effort the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author </s>
<s> the phonograph today for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera </s>
<s> not surprisingly this approach did not work </s>
<s> the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names </s>
<s> but no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies </s>
<s> in general religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis </s>
<s> congregational membership however is another thing </s>
<s> a congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership </s>
<s> that is when it can preserve economic integration </s>
<s> religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining </s>
<s> the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition </s>
<s> the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches </s>
<s> the central city areas in other words exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations they have too few middle-class people </s>
<s> they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents </s>
<s> central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities </s>
<s> with few exceptions the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city </s>
<s> the key to protestant development therefore is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation </s>
<s> members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus so that protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes </s>
<s> but this is deceptive for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum </s>
<s> the congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood </s>
<s> moreover residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive </s>
<s> they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration </s>
<s> the congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group </s>
<s> it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship </s>
<s> they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers </s>
<s> we have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers </s>
<s> consequently the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in protestant congregations </s>
<s> actually there is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations as we shall see in another connection </s>
<s> the vulnerability of protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform therefore to the principle of economic integration </s>
<s> this fact is evident in the recruitment of new members </s>
<s> mission as co-optation </s>
<s> the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations </s>
<s> theologians have been stressing the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world </s>
<s> a crucial question therefore is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism </s>
<s> if economic integration really shapes congregational life then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration </s>
<s> the task of a congregation would be defined according to economic integration as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation </s>
<s> it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization </s>
<s> this recruitment however must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation </s>
<s> evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches </s>
<s> one study in pittsburgh however has illuminated the situation </s>
<s> on the surface this seems a sound approach to christian mission members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people </s>
<s> the new people respond in kind by joining the church </s>
<s> missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods </s>
<s> the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position </s>
<s> association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations </s>
<s> this means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation </s>
<s> the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation </s>
<s> the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation </s>
<s> churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration </s>
<s> the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities worship preaching and publicity in reaching new members </s>
<s> in general friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church </s>
<s> economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood </s>
<s> the inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together </s>
<s> economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation </s>
<s> in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation </s>
<s> the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance </s>
<s> the expense of this type of organization in religious life when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned raises fundamental questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society </s>
<s> nonetheless the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the protestant development </s>
<s> these trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis </s>
<s> residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions </s>
<s> the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized </s>
<s> the schism between central city and suburb negro and white blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis </s>
<s> it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings </s>
<s> the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations </s>
<s> this conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment </s>
<s> more than creatures of metropolitan forces the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples </s>
<s> since american life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis </s>
<s> consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests </s>
<s> negroes puerto ricans and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities </s>
<s> soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century </s>
<s> mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion </s>
<s> this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches </s>
<s> it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes </s>
<s> it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity since worship presupposes some local stabilities </s>
<s> whatever projection one makes the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people </s>
<s> attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches </s>
<s> this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes </s>
<s> the keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem </s>
<s> these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman dictating the methods of child rearing determining the pattern of community participation setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness and informing the congregational life of the major denominations </s>
<s> its contents are another matter for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation </s>
<s> what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church </s>
<s> an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity </s>
<s> the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need </s>
<s> with capital largely squandered there seemed to them no other course to pursue </s>
<s> the directors sold directly to concessionaires who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company </s>
<s> these concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the indians through engages who might be habitants voyageurs or even soldiers </s>
<s> the concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to france in company ships </s>
<s> the company disposed of the pelts but with what profit the records do not show </s>
<s> in accord with its penurious policy the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians </s>
<s> the lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade of new france and louisiana in the previous century and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men </s>
<s> traders from the english colonies were far more generous and indian loyalty turned to them </s>
<s> protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company </s>
<s> they adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts </s>
<s> in each of these there was to be a strong military post and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses </s>
<s> for southeastern louisiana mobile was the principal post and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east in the region threatened by british traders </s>
<s> mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the tennessee river </s>
<s> west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi district of which new orleans was headquarters </s>
<s> dependent upon it were posts on the lower mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of new spain </s>
<s> on the middle mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas </s>
<s> it was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west principally down the arkansas river </s>
<s> other posts would be established up the ohio and wabash to protect communication with canada </s>
<s> each of the five principal posts was to have a director responsible to a director-general at new orleans </s>
<s> an elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way </s>
<s> concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors </s>
<s> engages must be loyal to the concessionaires and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended </s>
<s> the habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires </s>
<s> new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi and west of that river and on the ohio and wabash </s>
<s> mobile was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district </s>
<s> the power that bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined </s>
<s> regulations for the indian trade were made by the conseil superieure de la louisiane and bienville apparently did not have control of that body </s>
<s> it decided also that the purely secular efforts of bienville were insufficient and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen carolinians </s>
<s> during the first administration of bienville the peltry trade of the mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue </s>
<s> these deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods </s>
<s> during his first administration bienville succeeded in keeping carolina traders out of the alabama country and the choctaw country </s>
<s> the director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french goods of a kind to which they were accustomed to supply the indian needs </s>
<s> the alabama and tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply </s>
<s> de la laude commander of the alabama post had the friendship of the natives and was able to make them look upon the british as poor competitors </s>
<s> he became after a time commander of a post on the alabama river but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade </s>
<s> the chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district </s>
<s> their territory lay to the north near the sources of the alabama the tombigbee the tennessee and cumberland rivers and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by cherokees </s>
<s> venturesome traders however continued to come to them from mobile and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the french markets </s>
<s> british traders from south carolina incited the indians against the french and there developed french and british factions in the tribe </s>
<s> the chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana </s>
<s> to hold them was an essential part of french policy for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to mobile </s>
<s> they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the french settlements near the gulf </s>
<s> bienville realized that if the french were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of british goods french traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the carolinians and at reasonable prices </s>
<s> his urgings brought some results </s>
<s> the company of the indies promised to send over a supply of indian trading goods and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins </s>
<s> but it coupled with this a requirement that indians must bring their pelts to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the indian country </s>
<s> for two years his friend and cousin boisbriant remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance </s>
<s> although he incited a few friendly indians to pillage the invaders and even kill some of them the carolina advance continued </s>
<s> but the company of the indies holding to its program of economy made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices </s>
<s> to the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy </s>
<s> perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the indians </s>
<s> these agents were to ascertain the difference between english and french goods and the prices charged the indians </s>
<s> they were to conciliate the unfriendly savages and wherever possible to incite the natives to pillage the traders from carolina </s>
<s> they were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering </s>
<s> the savages divided into two factions </s>
<s> one was british and the other french </s>
<s> so hostile did these factions become that among the choctaws civil war broke out </s>
<s> he asked the government for two hundred soldiers who were to be specifically assigned to arrest english traders and disloyal indians </s>
<s> he asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the indians pelts </s>
<s> but they brought back few pelts to pay their debts and soon french trade in the region was at an end </s>
<s> the indians were not impressed and held to the carolina traders who swarmed over the country almost to the mississippi </s>
<s> with the loss of the mobile trade which ended all profits from louisiana the natchez indians revolted </s>
<s> they destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods and harassed french shipping on the mississippi </s>
<s> the war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts </s>
<s> it offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade but asked an indemnity </s>
<s> thenceforth the commerce of louisiana was free to all frenchmen </s>
<s> company rule in louisiana left the colony without fortifications arms munitions or supplies </s>
<s> the difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families </s>
<s> others left the country and there was no one familiar with the indian trade </s>
<s> if this trade should be resumed the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans and soldiers discharged from the army must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois </s>
<s> this was a slow and difficult course and french trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders </s>
<s> these men were without capital or experience </s>
<s> perier and salmon the intendant wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts </s>
<s> with no company to interfere he kept close control over all the traders </s>
<s> in order to compete with english traders bienville radically changed the price schedule </s>
<s> they would be particularly displeased with the state department if it were the source of such reports </s>
<s> few things are more perilous for the state department than a displeased congressman </s>
<s> the reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state spends so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are so available </s>
<s> first the state department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters </s>
<s> businessmen will rise if congress attacks the commerce department </s>
<s> labor restrains undue brutality toward the labor department </s>
<s> the chamber of commerce assaults upon the treasury </s>
<s> a kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the department of health education and welfare </s>
<s> tampering with the post office may infuriate every voter who can write </s>
<s> with all these agencies the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly </s>
<s> no such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the state department in anger </s>
<s> in many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson </s>
<s> after all the money dispensed by state goes not to the farmer the laborer or the businessman but to foreigners </s>
<s> not only do these foreigners not vote for american congressmen </s>
<s> the chances are excellent that he will </s>
<s> people in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers </s>
<s> state keeps the junketeering list a secret </s>
<s> the department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion </s>
<s> congress is a harsh master </s>
<s> its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way </s>
<s> but come the next session of congress state can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats </s>
<s> diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence not with nikita khrushchev but with john rooney </s>
<s> nothing worked </s>
<s> rooney remained untouched </s>
<s> news of the project reached the press </s>

<s> with its power to investigate the senate can paralyze the secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees as it did with dean acheson </s>
<s> john foster dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson who was then operating the senate refused to let it become an inquisition </s>
<s> an internal police operation managed by scott mcleod a former fbi man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence was part of the vengeance </s>
<s> so was the attack upon charles e bohlen when eisenhower appointed him ambassador to moscow </s>
<s> the principal mauler however was senator joseph mccarthy </s>
<s> where acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the department dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates </s>
<s> fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way </s>
<s> during this dark chapter in state department history men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to capitol hill </s>

<s> here again it was vacation time and there were many things i could not see but i was able to visit with a professor who is famous in japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant </s>
<s> the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between attorney general rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should of course be applauded </s>
<s> but for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case </s>
<s> the suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the south and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in new york and general company policy </s>
<s> then the boycott would not be secondary but a primary one </s>
<s> perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order by threatening potential injury to its entire economy to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation </s>
<s> such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument and therefore of questionable justification </s>
<s> action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate </s>
<s> it is true of course that the end or objective of this action was different </s>
<s> but since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice and since in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force </s>
<s> the need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that white citizens councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence </s>
<s> an unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means </s>
<s> the end or aim of the action of course is also important especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights eg against negroes who register to vote in fayette county tennessee at the present moment </s>
<s> here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled and to legal remedies </s>
<s> it is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in christian morality like any other form of resistance </s>
<s> however it is also a christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward </s>
<s> it also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means </s>
<s> a trial of strength however is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent </s>
<s> and in warfare with any means men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause </s>
<s> this makes necessary a morality of means and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified </s>
<s> the question then is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him </s>
<s> here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives </s>
<s> and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently </s>
<s> a technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression </s>
<s> among christian groups the mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the christian use of all forms of pressure </s>
<s> since the will and word of god are for them concentrated in christ-like love it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing </s>
<s> without agreeing with every phrase in this statement we must certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any form of resistance and then go on beyond the mennonite position and affirm that christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance </s>
<s> these principles we have now set forth </s>
<s> economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted but clearly specified </s>
<s> and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means and apply to both alike justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action </s>
<s> economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed </s>
<s> that would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals </s>
<s> there must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance violent or non-violent </s>
<s> we may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above </s>
<s> there may be instances in which if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people </s>
<s> an excellent article was published recently in the journal of the church peace union by a south african journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in south africa amounting to virtual slavery and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the united states in these conditions </s>
<s> both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail </s>
<s> northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration </s>
<s> they have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state </s>
<s> and both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the southerners who are called bourbons </s>
<s> the name presumably derives from the french royal house which never learned and never forgot </s>
<s> since bourbon whiskey though of kentucky origin is at least as much favored by liberals in the north as by conservatives in the south </s>
<s> the nature of the opposition between liberals and bourbons is too little understood in the north </s>
<s> the race problem has tended to obscure other less emotional issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive </s>
<s> i write about northern liberals from considerable personal experience </s>
<s> a southerner married to a new englander i have lived for many years in a connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists writers publicity men and business executives of egghead tastes </s>
<s> most of them are democrats and nearly all consider themselves and are viewed as liberals </s>
<s> this is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism because it is clear that these democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal jefferson who held that the best government was the least government </s>
<s> yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view jefferson as one of their patron saints </s>
<s> when i question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy i find that they fall into two categories the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis </s>
<s> i am naive they say to make use of such words </s>
<s> this seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which under a president of the same stamp would try to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme court </s>
<s> as for states rights they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms </s>
<s> the american liberal may in the world of to-day have a strong case </s>
<s> but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one </s>
<s> it appears to be one of intense dislike which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of southern friends </s>
<s> his assumption seems to be that any such friends being tolerable humans must be more liberal than most southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views </s>
<s> theirs is no mere lack of sympathy but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against fascism </s>
<s> i do not think that my experience would be typical for southerners living in the north </s>
<s> in business circles usually conservative this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found </s>
<s> in fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south because it is not easy for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down </s>
<s> accounts have been published of northern liberals in the south up against segregationist prejudice especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view </s>
<s> but these accounts do not show that northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings </s>
<s> the strong feeling is certainly there </s>
<s> but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the south especially among those who studied in the north </s>
<s> and social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy if not sympathy toward resident and visiting northerners </s>
<s> also among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent southern attitude on most social problems </s>
<s> there are of course many souths </s>
<s> my definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the north won the war </s>
<s> nobody knows how many southerners there are in this category </s>
<s> i suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the north likes to believe </s>
<s> i never heard of a poll being taken on the question </s>
<s> no doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic </s>
<s> and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to little rock i believe the majority would have been for the old south </s>
<s> belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones </s>
<s> probably a larger percentage of virginians and south carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere with georgia north carolina and alabama following along after them </s>
<s> old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the tidewater than the piedmont </s>
<s> so that a line running down the length of the south marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the old south from the new but with of course important minority enclaves </s>
<s> the long-settled areas of states like virginia and south carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering and there the memory is more precious and the consciousness of loss the greater </s>
<s> also we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on charleston had closer ties with england and the west indies than with the north even after independence </s>
<s> the social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area </s>
<s> in certain respects defeat increased the persistent anglophilia of the old south </s>
<s> poor where they had once been rich humbled where they had been arrogant having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country </s>
<s> and no doubt many people in states like the carolinas and georgia which were among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century bitterly regretted the revolt against the crown </s>
<s> among bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors </s>
<s> all southerners agree that slavery had to go </s>
<s> but many historians maintain that except for northern meddling it would have ended in states like virginia years before it did </s>
<s> southern resentment has been over the method of its ending the invasion and reconstruction </s>
<s> their fears now are of miscegenation and negro political control in many counties </s>
<s> and this in effect means most of modern america </s>
<s> it is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise </s>
<s> and therein i feel many northerners delude themselves about the south </s>
<s> for one thing this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed </s>
<s> there seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it </s>
<s> or else the north really believes that all southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past and are now at heart sharers of the american dream like everybody else </s>
<s> if the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true </s>
<s> and the great majority of these people are of anglo-saxon or celtic descent </s>
<s> this is the only case in modern history of a people of britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination </s>
<s> the fact is due mainly to international wars both hot and cold </s>
<s> in every war of the united states since the civil war the south was more belligerent than the rest of the country </s>
<s> and there is no section of the nation more ardent than the south in the cold war against communism </s>
<s> it is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as southerners should have been as docile as they have </s>
<s> the north should thank its stars that such has been the case </s>
<s> but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom </s>
<s> the two main charges levelled against the bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries </s>
<s> there is much truth in both these charges and not many bourbons deny them </s>
<s> whatever their faults they are not hypocrites </s>
<s> most of them sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure </s>
<s> many northeners believe this too but few of them will say so publicly </s>
<s> the bourbon economic philosophy moreover is not very different from that of northern conservatives </s>
<s> but those among the bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this </s>
<s> they believe that if the south had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern america </s>
<s> their own easier slower tempo is especially dear to southerners </s>
<s> and i have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up north because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town </s>
<s> in the past the duties of the state as sir henry maine noted long ago were only two in number internal order and external security </s>
<s> by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders </s>
<s> the enormous changes in world politics have however thrown it into confusion so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era </s>
<s> beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility either internally or externally </s>
<s> this was particularly true in the world arena which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires </s>
<s> that any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman </s>
<s> his duty was to his sovereign and to his nation and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated </s>
<s> at the same time all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted </s>
<s> social darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century </s>
<s> however in recent decades for what doubtless are multiple reasons an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity </s>
<s> a concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment </s>
<s> already firmly implanted internally it is a growing factor in external matters </s>
<s> a little more than twenty years ago the american people turned an important corner </s>
<s> of greater importance however is the content of those programs which have had and are having enormous consequences for the american people </s>
<s> labor relations have been transformed income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms and all the many facets of the american version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom </s>
<s> a national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary </s>
<s> the other of course was the civil war the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation </s>
<s> a third one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance is now being traversed american immersion and involvement in world affairs </s>
<s> internal national responsibility now a truism need not be documented </s>
<s> that guiding principle of the hoover administration fell to the siege guns of the new deal </s>
<s> internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the industrial revolution </s>
<s> reduced to its simplest terms it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era </s>
<s> national responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the united states or even to the western nations </s>
<s> meeting in new delhi under the auspices of the international commission of jurists a body of lawyers from the free world the congress redefined and expanded the traditional rule of law to include affirmative governmental duties </s>
<s> it is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the congress were from the less developed former colonial nations </s>
<s> the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-soviet world </s>
<s> for better or for worse we all now live in welfare states the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being </s>
<s> the hypothesis ventured here is that it does and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition </s>
<s> external national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations </s>
<s> if internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism </s>
<s> the breakup of the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism led not more than two centuries ago to the surge of nationalism </s>
<s> but it is more than that </s>
<s> for it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit </s>
<s> today as new nations rise from the former colonial empires nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world </s>
<s> historically however the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the western civilizational group </s>
<s> by subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has to some degree at least broadened the capacity for individual liberty </s>
<s> within their confines moreover technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied </s>
<s> while the pattern is uneven some having gained more than others nationalism has in fact served the western peoples well </s>
<s> but it is more than irony one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet </s>
<s> in other words nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application both as to geography and as to population </s>
<s> it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis </s>
<s> complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty </s>
<s> the former receives its legitimacy from the latter </s>
<s> operating side by side together they helped shore up the nation-state </s>
<s> while sovereignty has roots in antiquity in its present usage it is essentially modern </s>
<s> jean bodin writing in the sixteenth century may have been the seminal thinker but it was the vastly influential john austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood </s>
<s> the nation-state then exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control </s>
<s> in fact however both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined </s>
<s> high-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision </s>
<s> nevertheless nationalism and sovereignty are reputed in the accepted wisdom to describe the modern world </s>
<s> both concepts are undergoing alteration </s>
<s> to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility </s>
<s> as evidence to support that view consider the following illustrative instances </s>
<s> there is unceasing pressure but its sources are immediate </s>
<s> each could be the real thing </s>
<s> there is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks </s>
<s> they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels switches flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines </s>
<s> they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details </s>
<s> accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks </s>
<s> already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security </s>
<s> work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons </s>
<s> these men are not callous </s>
<s> it is their job to think about the unthinkable </s>

<s> to the sac command and control post forty-five feet below the ground at offutt air force base near omaha nebraska </s>
<s> to the joint war room of the joint chiefs of staff in the pentagon and to the president </s>
<s> telephones teletypes several kinds of radio systems and in some cases television link all vital points </s>
<s> alternate locations exist for all key command centers </s>
<s> multiple circuits routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible </s>
<s> and no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance by special codes that the messages actually come from their purported sources </s>
<s> additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications </s>
<s> only the president is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons </s>
<s> the president cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger </s>
<s> he makes the momentous decision </s>
<s> hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons </s>
<s> nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers </s>
<s> however the system is designed ingeniously and hopefully so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war </s>
<s> all can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes </s>
<s> all could help the president make his decision </s>
<s> the talk would not be in code but neither would it ramble </s>
<s> vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda </s>
<s> if communications work his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order </s>
<s> for these centers too are on the gold circuit </s>
<s> nato headquarters in europe </s>
<s> air force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases </s>
<s> and sac which controls long-range bombers and atlas missiles </s>

<s> his eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown </s>
<s> his movements and speech are precise clear and quick </s>
<s> no question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate </s>
<s> at least a dozen men some armed are never far away from him </s>
<s> in front of him is a gold phone </s>
<s> in emergencies the sac commander gen thomas power or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above wisman and his staff </s>
<s> general power would participate in the decision making </s>
<s> wisman below would listen in and act </s>
<s> his consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every sac aircraft </s>
<s> he need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left right next to the big red button marked alert </s>
<s> but wisman too does not know the go code </s>
<s> they are supplied a batch at a time by a secret source and are continually changed by wisman or his staff at random intervals </s>
<s> they are mere fragments just one portion of preprepared messages </s>
<s> what these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed </s>
<s> i asked wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one </s>
<s> they too have fragments of the go code with them </s>
<s> once we send out the whole pie they can put their pieces into it </s>
<s> the answer is a cryptographic secret </s>
<s> after that it requires several minutes of concentrated work including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber each with another man beside him to help for an armed bomb to be released </s>
<s> suddenly however their posture changed and the game ended </s>
<s> they went as rigid as black statuary six figures lean and tall and angular went still </s>
<s> their heads were in the air sniffing </s>
<s> they all swung at the same instant in the same direction </s>
<s> they saw it before i did even with my binoculars </s>
<s> it was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth </s>
<s> a white man would not have seen it </s>
<s> the aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos </s>
<s> watching they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land </s>
<s> at once the whole band set off at a lope </s>
<s> they were chasing a rain cloud </s>
<s> they went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow </s>
<s> i followed them in the jeep and now they did not care </s>
<s> the games were over this was life </s>
<s> occasionally for no reason that i could see they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot </s>
<s> sometimes i guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction </s>
<s> sometimes it was to skirt a gulley </s>
<s> their gait is impossible to convey in words </s>
<s> it has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it it is not a lope it is not done with style or verve </s>
<s> it is the gait of the human who must run to live arms dangling legs barely swinging over the ground head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful </s>
<s> it is a barely controlled skimming of the ground </s>
<s> they ran for three hours </s>
<s> finally avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground they intercepted the rain squall </s>
<s> for ten minutes they ran beneath the squall raising their arms and for the first time shouting and capering </s>
<s> then the wind died and the rain squall held steady </s>
<s> they were studying the ground </s>
<s> suddenly one of them shouted ran a few feet bent forward and put his mouth to the ground </s>
<s> he had found a depression with rain water in it </s>
<s> he bent down a black cranelike figure and put his mouth to the ground </s>
<s> with a lordly and generous gesture the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows </s>
<s> the other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle </s>
<s> in an instant he had sucked it dry </s>
<s> the aborigine lives on the cruelest land i have ever seen </s>
<s> which does not mean that it is ugly </s>
<s> part of it is of course </s>
<s> there are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous </s>
<s> they are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand </s>
<s> such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality </s>
<s> but much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable </s>
<s> it is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush has a peaceful quality the hills roll softly </s>
<s> the malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the australian charles bean </s>
<s> he tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer </s>
<s> the countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps </s>
<s> nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men </s>
<s> it might have rained any time </s>
<s> there might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise </s>
<s> they lay with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them </s>
<s> the white men died </s>
<s> and countless others like them have died </s>
<s> even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction were tortured by the heat driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape and who finally died </s>
<s> the aborigine is not deceived </s>
<s> he knows that the land is hard and pitiless </s>
<s> there is no room for error or waste </s>
<s> any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done </s>
<s> i do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge but i suspect that it can </s>
<s> perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity </s>
<s> the family at the boulder </s>
<s> seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing </s>
<s> many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports </s>
<s> it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language </s>
<s> finally however the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a land rover </s>
<s> we followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth </s>
<s> the rancher went a mile down this road and then when he reached a big red boulder swung off the road </s>
<s> at once he started to glance toward the instrument panel </s>
<s> it took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel there was a gimbaled compass welded to it which rocked gently back and forth as the land rover bounced about </s>
<s> the rancher was navigating his way across the flatland </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks a tree here a wash here a boulder there </s>
<s> two miles northeast then five miles southwest that sort of thing </s>
<s> he was right </s>
<s> the landscape kept repeating itself </s>
<s> i would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless </s>
<s> finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines </s>
<s> they were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder a man his lubra and two children </s>
<s> the sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder </s>
<s> there was also a dog a dingo dog </s>
<s> its ribs showed it was a yellow nondescript color it suffered from a variety of sores hair had scabbed off its body in patches </s>
<s> it lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving watching us carefully </s>
<s> it struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog </s>
<s> no one patted the dog </s>
<s> it was not a pet </s>
<s> it was a worker </s>
<s> we drove close to the boulder stopped the land rover and walked over toward the family </s>
<s> the man was leaning against the rock </s>
<s> he gazed away from us as we approached </s>
<s> he was over six feet tall and very thin </s>
<s> his legs were narrow and very long </s>
<s> every bone and muscle in his body showed but he did not give the appearance of starving </s>
<s> he had long black hair and a wispy beard </s>
<s> the ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut </s>
<s> there was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what </s>
<s> it was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets </s>
<s> the australian and i both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine </s>
<s> i turned to look at the lubra </s>
<s> she remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there </s>
<s> like the man she was entirely naked </s>
<s> her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her </s>
<s> there were two rubbing sticks for making fire two stones shaped roughly like knives a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent </s>
<s> there was also a long wooden spear and a woomera a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy </s>
<s> there was also a boomerang elaborately carved </s>
<s> everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless </s>
<s> the two children both boys wandered around the australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work </s>
<s> they squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward their eyes only a few inches from the ground </s>
<s> they had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground the boys picked them up one at a time and pinched them dead </s>
<s> the tiny bodies dropped onto a dry leaf made a pile as big as a small apple </s>
<s> the odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines </s>
<s> the smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant </s>
<s> it was also subtly familiar for it was the odor of the human body but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed </s>
<s> but that is a cliche and a dishonest one </s>
<s> the smell is sexual but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it </s>
<s> their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin </s>
<s> they roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it </s>

<s> but more important and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see is that these places and activities are often the settings in which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities </s>
<s> these things are important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary </s>
<s> a few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor </s>

<s> nowhere in isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the persians shown so well as during the promenade at the khaju bridge </s>
<s> there has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city </s>
<s> for one thing there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed </s>
<s> for another it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in </s>
<s> it is a splendid structure </s>
<s> from upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river </s>
<s> from downstream where the water level is much lower it is a high elaborately facaded pavilion </s>
<s> the top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile </s>
<s> at either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses </s>
<s> below twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge </s>
<s> these are traversed by another line of vaults and thus rooms arched on all four sides are formed </s>
<s> down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise the mountains and river pools </s>
<s> here on the hottest day it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults </s>
<s> out of water brick and tile they have made far more than just a bridge </s>
<s> on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge </s>
<s> it is a great spectacle </s>
<s> the bridge itself rises up from the river light-flared and enormous like the outdoor set for an epic opera </s>

<s> once again as in the days of the founding fathers america faces a stern test </s>
<s> incapable of self-delusion the founding fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave and yet they had confidence that america would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty </s>
<s> in certain respects their task was incomparably greater than ours today for there was nobody before them to show them the way </s>
<s> accordingly they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity </s>
<s> strong men with strong opinions frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet the founding seven were essentially congenial minds and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences </s>
<s> even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning american independence and founding a new nation </s>
<s> before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary </s>
<s> certainly no other seven american statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years </s>
<s> eldest of the seven benjamin franklin a new englander transplanted to philadelphia wrote the most dazzling success story in our history </s>
<s> author of the albany plan of union which had it been adopted might have avoided the revolution he fought the colonists front-line battles in london negotiated the treaty of alliance with france and the peace that ended the war headed the state government of pennsylvania and exercised an important moderating influence at the federal convention </s>
<s> commanding the continental army for six long years of the revolution he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory </s>
<s> retiring to his beloved mount vernon he returned to preside over the federal convention and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected president </s>
<s> during his two terms the constitution was tested and found workable strong national policies were inaugurated and the traditions and powers of the presidential office firmly fixed </s>
<s> john adams fashioned much of pre-revolutionary radical ideology wrote the constitution of his home state of massachusetts negotiated with franklin and jay the peace with britain and served as our first vice president and our second president </s>
<s> his political opponent and lifetime friend thomas jefferson achieved immortality through his authorship of the declaration of independence but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native virginia his role as father of our territorial system and his acquisition of the louisiana territory during his first term as president </s>
<s> if franklin was an authentic genius then alexander hamilton with his exceptional precocity consuming energy and high ambition was a political prodigy </s>
<s> his bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the constitution stand as durable contributions </s>
<s> less dazzling than hamilton less eloquent than jefferson john jay commands an equally high rank among the founding fathers </s>
<s> he served as president of the continental congress </s>
<s> as first chief justice his strong nationalist opinions anticipated john marshall </s>
<s> he ended his public career as a two-term governor of new york </s>
<s> these seven founders constituted an intellectual and social elite the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed </s>
<s> their social status was achieved in some cases by birth as with washington jefferson and jay </s>
<s> unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day they commanded both prestige and influence before the revolution started </s>
<s> as different physically as the tall angular jefferson was from the chubby rotund adams the seven were striking individualists </s>
<s> ardent opinionated even obstinate they were amazingly articulate wrote their own copy and were masters of phrasemaking </s>
<s> capable of enduring friendships they were also stout controversialists who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens </s>
<s> the seven founders were completely dedicated to the public service </s>
<s> washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best plantation management </s>
<s> he served as commander in chief during the revolution without compensation </s>
<s> when the revolution broke out he along with jefferson and jay abandoned his career at the bar with considerable financial sacrifice </s>
<s> while he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends </s>
<s> to support his large family hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service </s>
<s> talleyrand passed his new york law office one night on the way to a party </s>
<s> hamilton was bent over his desk drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle </s>
<s> the frenchman was astonished </s>
<s> all seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality </s>
<s> this sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between john jay and a tory refugee peter van schaack </s>
<s> jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend van schaack </s>
<s> all seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation </s>
<s> all sought the fruition of that nationalism in a federal government with substantial powers </s>
<s> save jefferson all participated in the framing or ratification of the federal constitution </s>
<s> they supported it not as a perfect instrument but as the best obtainable </s>
<s> historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the seventeen nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs limited government with hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and jefferson and madison upholding the latter position </s>

<s> according to many critics in fact the south has led the north in literature since the civil war both quantitatively and qualitatively </s>
<s> such writers as william faulkner and robert penn warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance </s>
<s> of the stereotyped negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields </s>
<s> of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the south its progressive leaps of the past century </s>
<s> this is not to say that the south is no longer agrarian </s>
<s> such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification </s>
<s> but the south is and has been for the past century engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which oddly enough is not reflected in its literature </s>
<s> in a mere half-century the south has more than tripled its urban status </s>
<s> it is said that even at the present stage of southern urbanization such a city as atlanta is not distinctly unlike columbus or trenton </s>
<s> the effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force </s>
<s> the field then is ripe for new southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon the southern yankeefication the new urban economy the city-dweller the pains of transition the labor problems </s>
<s> the list is obviously endless </s>
<s> but these sources have not been tapped </s>
<s> william styron while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance insists he is not to be classified as a southern writer and yet includes traditional southern concepts in everything he publishes </s>
<s> such are simply not within his bounded province </s>
<s> perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades </s>
<s> lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as confederate money </s>
<s> the negro faces as much if not more difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one </s>
<s> this represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem </s>
<s> other examples of gradual changes that have affected the negro have been his moving up row by row in the buses </s>
<s> he has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws </s>
<s> this bold self-assertion after decades of humble subservience is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon an abrupt change in the southern way of existence </s>
<s> a new order is thrusting itself into being </s>
<s> a new south is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation uncertainty and lack of action from the negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man </s>
<s> the modern negro has not made a decisive debut into southern fiction </s>
<s> while there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamps scattered through the rural south such men appear to be a vanishing breed </s>
<s> writers openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man </s>
<s> but they obviously mean by this not a negro personality but a negro type </s>
<s> presenting an individualized negro character it would seem is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could tackle </s>
<s> and the success of such an endeavor is as suggested above glaringly rare </s>
<s> just as the negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting southern life it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in southern literature </s>
<s> all but the most rabid of confederate flag wavers admit that the old southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life </s>
<s> modern writers who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects insist upon drawing out this legend prolonging its burial when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century </s>
<s> perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing </s>
<s> but they can hardly deny that exaggerated or not the old panorama is dead </s>
<s> it bewilders and befuddles him </s>
<s> he is too deeply steeped in william faulkner and robert penn warren </s>
<s> the fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes but his heart is away in yoknapatawpha county with razorback hogs and night riders </s>
<s> no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what herrick dreiser and farrell did for chicago or dos passos did for new york </s>
<s> not a single southern author major or minor has made the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material </s>
<s> faulkner for one appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard </s>
<s> faulkner culminates the southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been or could ever be done </s>
<s> he has made it his and his it remains irrevocably </s>
<s> he treats it with a mythological universal application </s>
<s> as his disciples boast even though his emphasis is elsewhere faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the south quite keenly as can be proven by a quick recalling of his sartoris and snopes families </s>
<s> even two decades ago in go down moses faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the south might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil </s>
<s> yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact </s>
<s> faulkner traces in his vast and overpowering saga of yoknapatawpha county the gradual changes which seep into the south building layer upon layer of minute subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the old way </s>
<s> yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself the problems with which a new south must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization </s>
<s> with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil </s>
<s> the thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas </s>
<s> another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre </s>
<s> but robert rauschenberg the neo-dadaist artist has collaborated with several of them </s>
<s> mr nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor </s>
<s> in fact he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion shape light and sound </s>
<s> to raise the dancer out of his personal pedestrian self mr nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger environmental orbit </s>
<s> he began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be </s>
<s> the depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure </s>
<s> in each case the object the color even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer </s>
<s> the dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol begins to feel that it is part of herself </s>
<s> as the dancer is depersonalized his accouterments are animized and the combined elements give birth to a new being </s>
<s> from this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit </s>
<s> thus the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition </s>
<s> some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work </s>
<s> others less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet painter and musician </s>
<s> the creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience </s>
<s> the test of form is fidelity to the experience a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters </s>
<s> an earlier but still influential school of painting surrealism had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious </s>
<s> the resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order </s>
<s> the contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines colors masses and energies </s>
<s> he is still concerned however with a personal event </s>
<s> he accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation </s>
<s> the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience </s>
<s> some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher more serene level of truth </s>
<s> rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world </s>
<s> the concept remains subjective </s>
<s> others look to more objective devices of order </s>
<s> the musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that once set in motion determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities </s>
<s> he may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers </s>
<s> but he cannot order his elements by will either rational or inspired </s>
<s> the system works as an impersonal mechanism </s>
<s> musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development </s>
<s> again the composer must select his own materials </s>
<s> but a tossing of coins with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the i ching the chinese book of changes dictates the handling of the chosen materials </s>
<s> avant-garde choreographers seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements have turned to similar approaches </s>
<s> some let dances take their form from the experience of creation </s>
<s> the process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it </s>
<s> the sequence may involve a sharp contrast for example a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap </s>
<s> or it may involve more subtle distinctions the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head </s>
<s> even the least alteration will change the quality </s>
<s> an exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance </s>
<s> the approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic as it is for miss litz or spontaneous as it is for merle marsicano </s>
<s> looking back miss marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of jackson pollock </s>
<s> but her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form a need to let the experience shape itself </s>
<s> midi garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement </s>
<s> it may be a free front-back swing of the leg leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground </s>
<s> this became a dance called prelude to flight </s>
<s> a pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus </s>
<s> alwin nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion </s>
<s> if his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from mars this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities </s>
<s> it is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered </s>
<s> the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve </s>
<s> it may be a reaction to a percussive sound the following movements constituting further reactions </s>
<s> it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs </s>
<s> movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive </s>
<s> but the metamorphosis must come first </s>
<s> though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity merce cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim </s>
<s> he rejects all subjectively motivated continuity any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect </s>
<s> he bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything </s>
<s> thus there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well </s>
<s> the sequence of movements in a cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life </s>
<s> at one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly </s>
<s> nearby another sits motionless while still another is twirling an umbrella </s>
<s> a man and a girl happen to meet </s>
<s> they look straight at the audience not at each other </s>
<s> he lifts her puts her down and walks off neither pleased nor disturbed as if nothing had happened </s>
<s> if one dancer slaps another the victim may do a pirouette sit down or offer his assailant a fork and spoon </s>
<s> events occur without apparent reason </s>
<s> the sequence is determined by chance and mr cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices </s>
<s> he may toss coins </s>
<s> he may take slips of paper from a grab bag </s>
<s> the answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed </s>
<s> the other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance </s>
<s> the only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves the number of the dancers and the approximate total duration of the dance </s>
<s> each performance may be different </s>
<s> if a work is divided into several large segments a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance </s>
<s> and any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether </s>
<s> mr cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method </s>
<s> he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can </s>
<s> however there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute </s>
<s> then the choreographer must arbitrate </s>
<s> he must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other </s>
<s> he must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap </s>
<s> the north and the south were in greater agreement on sovereignty through all their dispute about it than were the founding fathers </s>
<s> the truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of webster and calhoun and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of lincoln and lee </s>
<s> the people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles in understanding of and belief in the federal balance and in love of their union </s>
<s> nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty </s>

<s> the fact is that the southern confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the federal constitution did </s>
<s> the confederate constitution copied much of the federal constitution verbatim and most of the rest in substance </s>
<s> it operated on by and for the people individually just as did the federal constitution </s>
<s> it made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments and among the executive legislative and judicial branches </s>
<s> its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their constitution </s>
<s> these are not however differences in federal structure </s>
<s> the only important differences from that standpoint between the two constitutions lies in their preambles </s>
<s> one is tempted to say that on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles the worst war of the nineteenth century was fought </s>
<s> but though the southern states when drafting a constitution to unite themselves narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede the fact remained that by seceding from the union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states </s>
<s> if the union conceded this to them the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their union </s>
<s> though his election was interpreted by many southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the union lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the constitution gave the states </s>
<s> after the war began he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action even in the border states that stayed with the union </s>
<s> he issued his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the union </s>
<s> what lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the union </s>
<s> the truth on each side won in the civil war </s>
<s> he understood that both sides were at fault and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his second inaugural </s>
<s> the very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method war led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for since it forced lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure </s>
<s> there was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another </s>
<s> there was also a lesson one that has served ever since to keep americans in their conflicts with one another from turning from the ballot to the bullet </s>
<s> yet though the southern states lost the worst errors in their case they did not lose the truth they fought for </s>
<s> the useful suggestion of professor david hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments </s>
<s> one wonders about its applicability to people </s>
<s> the answer is of course yes </s>
<s> for the family is the simplest example of just such a unit composed of people which gives us both some immunity from and a way of dealing with other people </s>
<s> social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of archimedes </s>
<s> but it has been during the last two centuries during the scientific revolution that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides </s>
<s> we have ample light when the sun sets </s>
<s> the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons </s>
<s> we fly through the air although gravity pulls us down </s>
<s> the range of our voice ignores distance </s>
<s> there is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in copernicus and in freud </s>
<s> and it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact </s>
<s> political theoretical understanding although almost at a standstill during this century did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man </s>
<s> consitutional government popular vote trial by jury public education labor unions cooperatives communes socialized ownership world courts and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples </s>
<s> most of these with horrible exceptions were conceived as is a ship not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind nor to deny its force but as a means to survive and enjoy it </s>
<s> the most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme </s>
<s> just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding </s>
<s> we are desperately in the need of such invention for man is still very much at the mercy of man </s>
<s> in fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other </s>
<s> i want therefore to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science the connection between scientific understanding and fear </s>
<s> there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears </s>
<s> perhaps things were even worse then </s>
<s> it is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man </s>
<s> we get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was </s>
<s> we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets </s>
<s> the bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage </s>
<s> i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly </s>
<s> they are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual </s>
<s> they include both individual fears and collective ones </s>
<s> they arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group </s>
<s> often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective and the whole pattern becomes ritualized </s>
<s> yet often fear persists because even with the most rigid ritual one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act </s>
<s> to say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition </s>
<s> but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating </s>
<s> the frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize </s>
<s> it is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice </s>
<s> this and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually first with the ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then more firmly with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions </s>
<s> this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls </s>
<s> in fact although we have dispelled the fear we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers </s>
<s> there is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision </s>
<s> a meteor could fall on san francisco </s>
<s> solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought </s>
<s> our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which in this case amounts to doing nothing </s>
<s> yet we no longer feel uneasy </s>
<s> this almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war </s>
<s> we in our country think of war as an external threat which if it occurs will not be primarily of our own doing </s>
<s> and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave </s>
<s> we have staved off a war and since our behavior has involved all these elements we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective </s>
<s> i think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city </s>
<s> if an automobile were approaching him he would know what was required of him even though he might not be able to act quickly enough </s>
<s> with the group of boys it is different </s>
<s> he does not know whether to look up or look aside to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side to cross the street or to continue on the same side </s>
<s> when confronted with a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others </s>
<s> i believe that what i do has some effect on his actions and i have learned in a way to commune with drunks but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics </s>
<s> i am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose </s>
<s> our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise </s>
<s> we are forced in our behavior towards others to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements </s>
<s> our collective policies group and national are similarly based on voodoo but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them </s>
<s> we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles </s>
<s> we perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect </s>
<s> small wonder then that we fear </s>
<s> the achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago </s>
<s> in the physical sciences these achievements concern electricity chemistry and atomic physics </s>
<s> in the life sciences there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease in the mechanisms of heredity and in bio- and physiological chemistry </s>
<s> the major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment </s>
<s> in addition our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed </s>
<s> even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking but where some explanations are possible as with lightning and weather and earthquakes the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated </s>
<s> apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears </s>
<s> how and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study </s>
<s> in some areas the progress is slower than in others </s>
<s> in agriculture for example despite the advances in biology elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster </s>
<s> in child care the opposite extreme prevails </s>
<s> procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory </s>
<s> there are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear </s>
<s> much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared </s>
<s> the persistent horror of having a malformed child has i believe been reduced not because we have gained any control over this misfortune but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it </s>
<s> in fact the recent warnings about the use of x-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding and thus in this instance science has momentarily aggravated our fears </s>
<s> in fact insofar as science generates any fear it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise which until they are understood create uncertainty </s>
<s> perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease </s>
<s> the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear i have tried to describe </s>
<s> nothing like godot he arrived before the hour </s>
<s> his letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday and i came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve </s>
<s> he was waiting </s>
<s> my wish to meet samuel beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work </s>
<s> american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic </s>
<s> they find deep pessimism in them </s>
<s> i knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions because a man is not the same as his writing in the last analysis the questions had to be settled by the work itself </s>
<s> nevertheless i was curious </s>
<s> my curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation i had with a well-informed teacher of literature a jesuit father at a conference on religious drama near paris </s>
<s> that i thought is at least one thing i can find out when we meet </s>
<s> the features of his face are distinct but not fine </s>
<s> they look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel </s>
<s> unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead standing so high that the top falls gently over as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle </s>
<s> one might say it combines the man </s>
<s> own pride and humility </s>
<s> for he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility perhaps of the same genesis not to impose himself upon another </s>
<s> his light blue eyes set deep within the face are actively and continually looking </s>
<s> he seems by some unconscious division of labor to have given them that one function and no other leaving communication to the rest of the face </s>
<s> the mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile </s>
<s> the voice is light in timbre with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage </s>
<s> the irish accent is as one would expect combined with slight inflections from the french </s>
<s> his tweed suit was a baggy gray and green </s>
<s> he wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie </s>
<s> the conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering </s>
<s> for one thing the world that beckett sees is already shattered </s>
<s> i reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation </s>
<s> what appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words </s>
<s> we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion </s>
<s> it is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in </s>
<s> the only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess </s>
<s> i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth but beckett did not take to the word truth </s>
<s> to swim is true and to sink is true </s>
<s> one is not more true than the other </s>
<s> one cannot speak anymore of being one must speak only of the mess </s>
<s> i am not a philosopher </s>
<s> then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form </s>
<s> until recently art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things </s>
<s> it has held them at bay </s>
<s> it realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form </s>
<s> i granted this might be so but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously </s>
<s> if we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form </s>
<s> it only means that there will be new form and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else </s>
<s> the form and the chaos remain separate </s>
<s> the latter is not reduced to the former </s>
<s> that is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates </s>
<s> the classical lines of the church which napoleon thought of as a temple of glory dominated all the scene where we sat </s>
<s> the boulevard de la madeleine the boulevard malesherbes and the rue royale ran to it with graceful flattery bearing tidings of the age of reason </s>
<s> this is clear </s>
<s> this does not allow the mystery to invade us </s>
<s> with classical art all is settled </s>
<s> but it is different at chartres </s>
<s> i asked about the battle between life and death in his plays </s>
<s> didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide </s>
<s> if life and death did not both present themselves to us there would be no inscrutability </s>
<s> if there were only darkness all would be clear </s>
<s> it is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable </s>
<s> two thieves are crucified with christ one saved and the other damned </s>
<s> in classical drama such problems do not arise </s>
<s> as she goes she herself will be illuminated </s>
<s> at the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark </s>
<s> that is the play </s>
<s> within this notion clarity is possible but for us who are neither greek nor jansenist there is not such clarity </s>
<s> but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable </s>
<s> given a theological lead i asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays </s>
<s> i have no religious feeling </s>
<s> once i had a religious emotion </s>
<s> it was at my first communion </s>
<s> no more </s>
<s> my mother was deeply religious </s>
<s> so was my brother </s>
<s> he knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel </s>
<s> my father had none </s>
<s> the family was protestant but for me it was only irksome and i let it go </s>
<s> my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died </s>
<s> at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie </s>
<s> irish catholicism is not attractive but it is deeper </s>
<s> when you pass a church on an irish bus all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross </s>
<s> some people object to this in my writing </s>
<s> as if it were perverse to do so </s>
<s> he wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood </s>
<s> i told him no that i had had a very happy childhood </s>
<s> then he thought me more perverse than ever </s>
<s> i left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi </s>

<s> one does not have to look for distress </s>
<s> lunch was over and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris screaming at us </s>
<s> the personal quality of samuel beckett is similar to qualities i had found in the plays </s>
<s> he says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern </s>
<s> at the same time he is plainly sympathetic clearly friendly </s>
<s> if there were only the mess all would be clear </s>
<s> but there is also compassion </s>
<s> as a christian i know i do not stand where beckett stands but i do see much of what he sees </s>
<s> as a writer on the theater i have paid close attention to the plays </s>

<s> it is a mystique and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse </s>
<s> the singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place </s>
<s> the dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire </s>
<s> for this reason too their language is more forthright and earthy </s>
<s> the beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates </s>
<s> it is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy </s>

<s> jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect </s>
<s> jazz is the musical language of sex the vocabulary of the orgasm </s>
<s> indeed it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz by freeing the listener of his inhibitions can have therapeutic value </s>
<s> that is why the argument runs the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it </s>
<s> instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction </s>
<s> thus jazz is transmuted into something holy the sacred road to integration of being </s>
<s> jazz like sex is a mystique </s>
<s> it is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man </s>

<s> righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats </s>
<s> the beatnik seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present </s>

<s> he will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth </s>
<s> that is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians </s>
<s> they will destroy the shrines temples museums and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in </s>
<s> apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge </s>

<s> they will trust only their physical sensations the wisdom of the body the holy promptings of the unconscious </s>
<s> with lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate but their faith in love inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz culminates in the climax of the orgasm </s>
<s> their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath rootless and irresponsible </s>
<s> their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent </s>
<s> they are non-conformists on principle </s>
<s> when they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth the rage of repudiation the ecstasy of negation </s>
<s> it is sex that obsesses them sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed </s>
<s> what they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the muse </s>
<s> monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability </s>

<s> we were forbidden to swing on the gates lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way but we could stand on them when they were latched rest our chins on the top and stare and stare committing to memory quite unintentionally all the details that lay before our eyes </s>
<s> the street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an august afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees and silence was a weight almost palpable in the air </s>
<s> every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again crushed beneath it </s>
<s> a hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves </s>
<s> a wheel squeaked on a hub was still and squeaked again </s>
<s> the horse walked the reins were slack the huckster rode with bowed shoulders his forearms across his knees </s>

<s> they were like this fifty-odd years ago and yesterday </s>
<s> but the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago and when we stood on the gate to look over the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides </s>
<s> the curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees </s>
<s> opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse </s>

<s> his appearance as lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience </s>
<s> it is a spectacle absolutely painful an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation </s>
<s> by the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience </s>
<s> he collapses and dies </s>
<s> in the work of every artist i suppose there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive ultimately emblematic of what it is all about </s>

<s> when i try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance i come up with the following ideas which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay </s>
<s> the dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love </s>
<s> the release the freedom involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible </s>
<s> and the motion toward it brings disaster </s>
<s> this prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art </s>
<s> again the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood with the figure of a child </s>
<s> we shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates </s>
<s> for the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of jacoby at the moment of his collapse all these elements come together in prophetic parody </s>
<s> that this abandonment takes place on a stage during an artistic performance is enough to associate jacoby with art and to bring down upon him the punishment for art </s>
<s> in a certain perfectly definite way the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same </s>
<s> only slightly more perhaps than a newspaper account of such an incident would give </s>
<s> the artistic interest then lies in what the encounter may be made to represent in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness </s>
<s> and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction </s>
<s> the highroad one might say at first belongs to life while the way to the churchyard belongs to death </s>
<s> as the first sentence suggests both roads belong to death in the end </s>
<s> but the highroad according to the description of its traffic belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life a suffering form an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death </s>
<s> he is a widower his three children are dead he has no one left on earth </s>
<s> also he is a drunk and has lost his job on that account </s>
<s> this strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad </s>
<s> his rage assumes a religious form </s>
<s> this passion brings on a fit which proves fatal </s>
<s> then an ambulance comes along and they drive praisegod piepsam away </s>
<s> this is simple enough but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant </s>
<s> the season between spring and summer belongs to life in its carefree aspect </s>
<s> piepsam is not certainly religious in any conventional sense </s>
<s> his religiousness is intimately or dialectically connected with his sinfulness </s>
<s> the two may in fact be identical </s>
<s> his unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings </s>
<s> piepsam is grotesque a disturbing parody </s>
<s> his end is ridiculous and trivial </s>
<s> but he is more interesting than the others the ones who come from the highroad to watch him more interesting than life considered as a cyclist </s>
<s> it resembles too pictures such as durer and bruegel did in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary the representation of a proverb for example or a deadly sin </s>
<s> the monk savonarola brought over from the renaissance and placed against the background of munich at the turn of the century protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of m bluthenzweig </s>
<s> hieronymus like piepsam makes his protest quite in vain and his rejection though not fatal is ridiculous and humiliating </s>
<s> he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter </s>
<s> their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason </s>
<s> the breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes </s>
<s> thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers </s>
<s> the image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery </s>
<s> the image of god has simply disappeared </s>
<s> the person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems </s>
<s> whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive that they belong together </s>
<s> and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written </s>
<s> on the other hand we cannot regard artistic invention as pure uncaused and unrelated to the times in which it occurs </s>
<s> we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism </s>
<s> the mimetic imagination in the arts </s>
<s> aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and like plato he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level </s>
<s> but aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths </s>
<s> for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis in contrast to the power of dialectic is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality </s>
<s> here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent </s>
<s> artistic mimesis under christian influence records the involvement of all persons however humble in a divine drama </s>
<s> the artist unlike the philosopher is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction </s>
<s> he is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped </s>
<s> this is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated </s>
<s> mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself </s>
<s> the images themselves like their counterparts in experience are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately </s>
<s> they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another </s>
<s> they bring an inextricable component of value within themselves with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality </s>
<s> as in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images </s>
<s> mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense </s>
<s> similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field </s>
<s> a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy </s>
<s> the mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials </s>
<s> when words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves compelling the observer into an attitude of attention all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance </s>
<s> these are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice </s>
<s> the presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood </s>
<s> underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed </s>
<s> experience is not seen as it is in classical rationalism as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character movements and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect </s>
<s> neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs </s>
<s> in contrast to all this primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers </s>
<s> the most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings both positive and negative a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself </s>
<s> a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part </s>
<s> gone is the tabula rasa of the mind </s>
<s> our most elemental and unavoidable impressions he says are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future </s>
<s> we feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening </s>
<s> later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience </s>
<s> as long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity becomes an invention of consciousness and the result is a philosophical scepticism </s>
<s> whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail is initially given in the way man feels the world </s>
<s> in this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct </s>
<s> a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past </s>
<s> both i and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which i now am </s>

<s> equally a master of prose and verse he recreates the glory of sweden in the past and continues it into the present </s>
<s> in the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself </s>
<s> the family estate was situated near vadstena on lake vattern in south central sweden </s>
<s> it is a lonely rather desolate region but full of legendary and historic associations </s>
<s> he liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part </s>
<s> being somewhat delicate in health at the age of sixteen he was sent to southern europe for which he at once developed a passion so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad at first in italy then in greece egypt asia minor and palestine </s>
<s> in one of his summers at home he married to the great disapproval of his father who objected because of his extreme youth </s>
<s> deciding to become a painter he entered the studio of gerome in paris where he enjoyed the life of the artists but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction </s>
<s> in this final line we have the key to his nature </s>
<s> few writers have better understood their deepest selves </s>
<s> heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface </s>
<s> it may however be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in paris </s>
<s> strongly colorful plastic racy vivid </s>
<s> in a bold sometimes careless form there is nothing academic </s>
<s> all is seen and felt and experienced the observation is sharp and the imagination lively </s>
<s> the young poet-painter reproduces the french life of the streets </s>
<s> he tells stories of the thousand and one nights and conjures up before us the bazaars of damascus </s>
<s> in the care-free indolence of the east he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence and for that reason he loves it </s>
<s> it celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of neptune at paestum next to the parthenon the noblest example of grecian classic style now in existence </s>
<s> on the eve of his return to their native naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection </s>
<s> the supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled says the wife her husband has achieved immortality </s>
<s> not so he answers it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal </s>
<s> it slips away it burns and tortures me </s>
<s> he is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading </s>
<s> this restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in sweden </s>
<s> his cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present </s>
<s> he did not however find himself at once </s>
<s> from this time on heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self </s>
<s> he did not however settle back into acquiescence with things as they were </s>
<s> like his friend and contemporary august strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity </s>
<s> he saw sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory </s>
<s> about one-third as long it is less intimate and detailed but better coordinated more concise and more dramatic </s>
<s> hence the title of the book referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king </s>
<s> the charles men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories each depicting a special phase of the general subject </s>
<s> somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature </s>
<s> they comprise a great variety of scene and interest grim episodes of war idyllic interludes superb canvases of world-shaking events and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters </s>
<s> the general effect is tragic </s>
<s> almost nothing is said of charles spectacular victories the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat </s>
<s> to carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale </s>
<s> his peculiar gift as had been suggested before is his intensity </s>
<s> george meredith has said that fervor is the core of style </s>
<s> of few authors is this more true than of heidenstam </s>
<s> the charles men has a tremendous range of characters of common folk even more than of major figures </s>
<s> his purpose however was not to establish an empire but to assert the principle of divine justice </s>
<s> each aspired to be a god in human form but with each it was a different kind of god </s>
<s> each failed catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him </s>
<s> each is still glorified as a national hero </s>
<s> after the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous </s>
<s> like napoleon he was the worst of losers </s>
<s> there are however some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part concerning the reactions of the swedes in adversity </s>
<s> then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness </s>
<s> he finds it in utter misery and desolation </s>
<s> all his people ask for is no more war </s>
<s> but he plunges into yet another this time with norway and is killed in an assault on the fortress of fredrikshall being only thirty-six years of age when he died </s>
<s> he had become king at fifteen </s>
<s> then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling </s>
<s> from being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of sweden </s>
<s> slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral the shrine of so many precious memories </s>
<s> the guns are fired the hymns are sung and the body of charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors </s>
<s> as he had longed to be he became the echo of a saga </s>
<s> heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in swedish memory </s>
<s> excellent in their way they lack the wide appeal of the charles men and need not detain us here </s>
<s> admirably written it is a perfect introduction to swedish history for readers of other countries </s>
<s> some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural as suited to the legendary background </s>
<s> these are suggestive of selma lagerlof </s>
<s> the record teems with romance and adventure </s>
<s> today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases but his primary function remains what it has always been to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not </s>
<s> it is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited </s>
<s> the mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways </s>
<s> on the one hand he does not work for a large agency but is almost always self-employed </s>
<s> as a free-lance investigator the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client </s>
<s> on the other hand the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases </s>
<s> no client would ever think of asking him to do such things </s>
<s> whatever his original assignment the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime usually a murder </s>
<s> operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves </s>
<s> thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman </s>
<s> he is first and foremost a defender of public morals a servant of society </s>
<s> it is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective </s>
<s> by virtue of his self-reliance his individualism and his freedom from external restraint the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost </s>
<s> at the same time because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society because he likes to catch criminals he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man </s>
<s> in this way the private detective gets the best of two possible worlds </s>
<s> he is an individualist but not an anarchist </s>
<s> he is a public servant but not a cop </s>
<s> in the mystery story as in the wealth of nations individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin </s>
<s> there is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement adam smith was wrong </s>
<s> not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number he ended by destroying himself by giving birth to monopoly capitalism </s>
<s> driven from the marketplace by the course of history our hero disguises himself as a private detective </s>
<s> the birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal </s>
<s> even on the fictional level however the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved </s>
<s> the individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct he enforces the law without being told to do so </s>
<s> the private eye is therefore a moral man </s>
<s> but his morality rests upon that of his society </s>
<s> the basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal </s>
<s> unfortunately this assumption does not always hold good </s>
<s> if he is good he may not be legal </s>
<s> if he is legal he may not be good </s>
<s> it is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story </s>
<s> sherlock holmes is not merely an individualist </s>
<s> he is very close to being a mental case </s>
<s> holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants </s>
<s> he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln </s>
<s> he is a recluse an incredible egotist a confirmed misogynist </s>
<s> holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds </s>
<s> his eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom </s>
<s> it was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that holmes became a detective in the first place </s>
<s> holmes is a public servant to be sure </s>
<s> but the society which he serves bores him to tears </s>
<s> the curious relationship between holmes and scotland yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior </s>
<s> although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland yard holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police </s>
<s> on the face of it it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine </s>
<s> another more interesting explanation is hinted at by watson when he observes on several occasions that holmes would have made a magnificent criminal </s>
<s> the great detective modestly agrees </s>
<s> the two men resemble each other closely in their cunning their egotism their relentlessness </s>
<s> the first series of sherlock holmes adventures ends with holmes and moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff </s>
<s> they are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace </s>
<s> linked to holmes even in death moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant </s>
<s> just as holmes the eccentric stands behind holmes the detective so holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both </s>
<s> poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people </s>
<s> it is true that they are also extremely dull </s>
<s> their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a sherlock holmes </s>
<s> they fled from the victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy atlantic </s>
<s> like holmes the american private eye rejects the social conventions of his time </s>
<s> but unlike holmes he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt </s>
<s> his alienation is far more acute than holmes </s>
<s> he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast </s>
<s> wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids </s>
<s> in a society where everything is for sale marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought </s>
<s> his tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence </s>
<s> beaten bruised and exhausted he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low morals always alone always despised </s>
<s> in the end he gets his man but no one seems to care </s>
<s> virtue is its own and only reward </s>
<s> sam spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon </s>
<s> but when the bird is found at last it turns out to be a fake </s>
<s> now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves who is also the real murderer </s>
<s> for sam spade neither crime nor virtue pays </s>
<s> moreover it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two </s>
<s> because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police </s>
<s> the latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care </s>
<s> perry mason and hamilton burger nero wolfe and inspector cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal </s>
<s> frequently enough the police are themselves in league with the killer </s>
<s> but even when the police are honest they do not trust the private eye </s>
<s> he is like phillip marlowe too alienated to be reliable </s>
<s> finally in the maltese falcon among others the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion sam spade becomes the chief murder suspect </s>
<s> in order to exonerate himself he is compelled to find the real criminal who happens to be his girl friend </s>
<s> what was only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock holmes now appears as a direct accusation the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite </s>
<s> it is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma </s>
<s> by upholding his own personal code of behavior the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption </s>
<s> that society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo a potential criminal </s>
<s> if the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society </s>
<s> he must in short cease to be a detective and become a rebel </s>
<s> on the other hand if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism </s>
<s> dashiell hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery stories and turning to other pursuits </s>
<s> his successors have adopted the opposite alternative </s>
<s> in order to save the mystery story they have converted the private detective into an organization man </s>
<s> at first glance this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors </s>
<s> for hammer nothing is forbidden </s>
<s> he kills when he pleases takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge jury and executioner rolled into one </s>
<s> great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network </s>
<s> by monitoring we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers </s>
<s> as a word of caution we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types question command statement or exclamation </s>
<s> this sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car </s>
<s> if the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question it has served as an exclamation </s>
<s> on this basis certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes </s>

<s> we consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence </s>
<s> information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second- third- and fourth-hand as a distortable rumor </s>
<s> the numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors </s>
<s> it will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors h and e have six and p has only one while the remaining points have intermediate numbers </s>
<s> a point like p gets information directly from n but all information beyond n is indirectly relayed through n </s>
<s> the dweller at p is last to hear about a new cure the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses the one who goes the farthest to trade and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort </s>
<s> since the hazards of poor communication are so great p can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes a mine or a sugar maple camp </s>
<s> location theorists have given these matters much consideration </s>
<s> military organizations </s>
<s> the networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war </s>
<s> they also furnish proof that in modern war message sending must be monitored </s>
<s> without monitoring a military hookup becomes a noisy party </s>
<s> the need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling </s>
<s> alexander the great who used runners as message carriers did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once </s>
<s> as time has passed and science has progressed the speed of military vehicles has increased the range of missiles has been extended the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted and the range and breadth of message sending has increased </s>
<s> next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making network structure seems to be paramount and without monitoring no network has value </s>
<s> the monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence </s>
<s> commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank </s>
<s> the same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal </s>
<s> all orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks </s>
<s> this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility </s>
<s> the commands are specified by the military regulations </s>
<s> are few in number briefly worded all different in sound </s>
<s> and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground </s>
<s> this monitoring is necessary because on a parade ground everyone can hear too much and without monitoring a confused social event would develop </s>
<s> with troops dispersed on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication </s>
<s> in contrast to cocktail parties military organizations even in the field are more formal </s>
<s> a military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command </s>
<s> this objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action </s>
<s> the connective system or network is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory a college or a rural village </s>
<s> these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top six directly under him six under each of these and so on until there are six levels of personnel </s>
<s> this organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent </s>
<s> a further regulation is that commands always go down unaccompanied by statements and statements always go up unaccompanied by commands </s>
<s> not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare where the surveillance sending transmitting and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks </s>
<s> such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach </s>
<s> a team for useful research </s>
<s> this is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the germans or swiss for example in precision machinery and mathematics or the finns in geochemistry </s>
<s> we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes </s>
<s> this problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis </s>
<s> since the difficulty of drawing the net is great we will merely discuss it </s>
<s> first we realize that a pure specialist does not exist </s>
<s> but for practical purposes we have people who can be considered as such </s>
<s> for example there are persons who are in physical science in the field of mineralogy trained in crystallography who use only x-rays applying only the powder technique of x-ray diffraction to clay minerals only and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites </s>
<s> or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology studying the lung capacity of seven andean indians </s>
<s> so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops as contrasted to the generalist who knows less and less about more and more </s>
<s> american democratic thought pointed up the relation between the protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion which he called the american democratic faith </s>
<s> and he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law </s>
<s> but first i want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it </s>
<s> let me quote him even more fully for his analysis is important to my theme </s>
<s> and let me add utopianism also </s>
<s> i used his polarity to illustrate what i thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call progressivism </s>
<s> it seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man </s>
<s> and with progressivism the religion of humanity was replacing what gabriel called christian supernaturalism </s>
<s> and the common man was developing mythic power or charisma on his own </s>
<s> the socialism implicit in the slogan of the roosevelt revolution freedom from want and fear seems a far cry from the individualism of the first amendment to the constitution or of the jacksonian frontier </s>
<s> french egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of popularism </s>
<s> the first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under wilson </s>
<s> however it is important to trace the philosophy of the french revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former </s>
<s> yet after rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the general will the same philosophy it may be said became the idea source of the french revolution also </s>
<s> this notion of the general will gave rise to the commune of paris in the revolution and later brought napoleon to dictatorship </s>
<s> the long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy into a worship of man led logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under a socialist state </s>
<s> and the ussr existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism the ultimate exemplar </s>
<s> and by the time the war ended liberal leadership in this country was spiritually marxist </s>
<s> we of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation </s>
<s> during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal </s>
<s> all of this i know is recent history familiar to you </s>
<s> a perceptive journalist sam lubell has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates </s>
<s> he opens his discourse however with a review of the eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age </s>
<s> the show was colorful indeed exuberant but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny </s>
<s> lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue </s>
<s> i will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle with its limited and precarious success toward conservatism </s>
<s> it has moved on various levels it has been clamorous and confused </s>
<s> obviously there has been no agreement on what american conservatism is or rather what it should be </s>
<s> for it was neglected not to say nascent when the struggle began </s>
<s> i saw a piece the other day assailing william buckley author of man and god at yale and publisher of the national review as no conservative at all but an old liberal </s>
<s> i would agree with this view </s>
<s> one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election i suppose is that we the majority were dissatisfied with eisenhower conservatism </s>
<s> though to be sure we gave kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment </s>
<s> this is however symptomatic of our national malaise </s>
<s> but before i try to diagnose it i would offer other evidence </s>
<s> i will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year </s>
<s> the earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise sponsored by life magazine under the title of the national purpose </s>
<s> what i want to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals or modified liberals with perhaps one exception </s>
<s> i suppose we might classify billy graham as an old liberal </s>
<s> adlai stevenson expressed some reservations about this return </s>
<s> others invoked technology and common sense </s>
<s> but the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent </s>
<s> they perhaps gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that eisenhower requested that the commission be administered by the american assembly of columbia university because it was non-partisan </s>
<s> the commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the unconscious liberal but not unconscious enough to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism </s>
<s> this group is secularist and their program tends to be technological </s>
<s> father murray goes back to the declaration of independence too though i may add with considerably more historical perception </s>
<s> i will reserve discussion of it for a moment however to return to president kennedy </s>
<s> and the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic </s>
<s> ralph gabriel gave it the name of protestant philosophy of progress </s>
<s> here there may be an analogy with cancer we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth </s>
<s> noting such evidence is the first step </s>
<s> so an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation </s>
<s> hence the prime issue as i see it is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature </s>
<s> otherwise we go on endlessly trying to draw the line color and other as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate </s>
<s> we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted if nothing else </s>
<s> naturally this includes all communication forms eg languages or any social political economic or religious structures employed for such control </s>
<s> properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution </s>
<s> if we were creating a wholly new society we could insist that our social political economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man </s>
<s> best growth </s>
<s> but we cannot start off with a clean slate </s>
<s> asked which institution most needs correction i would say the corporation as it exists in america today </s>
<s> they were not diplomats or jazz musicians or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like henry ford hugh cooper thomas campbell the international harvester co and david w griffith </s>
<s> their kind created an american culture superior to any in the world an industrial and technological culture which penetrated russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies </s>
<s> corporations now outmoded </s>
<s> but even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of america foreigners can </s>
<s> no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts </s>
<s> if we want respect from ourselves or others we will have to earn it </s>
<s> first let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership </s>
<s> businesses must develop as a result of the ideas energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind </s>
<s> socialism i grant has a definite place in our society </s>
<s> but let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic </s>
<s> but the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life will not stand close scrutiny </s>
<s> its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham </s>
<s> it serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that </s>
<s> as to benefits to employees it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services </s>
<s> the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy </s>
<s> the corporation has a limited specific place in our society </s>
<s> ideally speaking it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society </s>
<s> examples are in public utilities making military aircraft and accessories or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form eg constructing major airports or dams </s>
<s> thus if corporations are not to run away with us they must become quasi-governmental institutions subject to public control and needs </s>
<s> proprietorship </s>
<s> avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society </s>
<s> and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests </s>
<s> such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer corporations cannot </s>
<s> it can project long-range goals for itself </s>
<s> corporations react violently to short-range stimuli eg quarterly and annual dividend reports </s>
<s> proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control </s>
<s> corporations being more amorphous cannot </s>
<s> proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity representing a human personality and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community </s>
<s> corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal inhumane shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public </s>
<s> the proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders </s>
<s> leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop </s>
<s> men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now </s>
<s> hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest </s>
<s> proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations eg the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth </s>
<s> the right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated </s>
<s> to perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore and is basically anti-democratic </s>
<s> when the proprietor dies the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it </s>
<s> strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent as they are each a part of the whole </s>
<s> strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship if internally motivated prevent a healthy relationship </s>
<s> certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so </s>
<s> one kind of proprietorship </s>
<s> these proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual who in turn would help us to cope with runaway technology </s>
<s> individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition </s>
<s> the battle is not easy </s>
<s> we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed enlightened competent leaders </s>
<s> also i am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership i would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees </s>
<s> any abilities i may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business coupled with raising my family </s>
<s> this combined experience on a foundation of very average i assure you intelligence and background has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against </s>
<s> the company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties neither having a formal education applicable to or experience in manufacturing or selling our type of articles </s>
<s> its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth </s>
<s> and no limitation is in evidence </s>
<s> our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time despite substantial well established competition </s>
<s> many americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force </s>
<s> postmaster general burleson set about to protect the american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails </s>
<s> then not many years later the un-american activities committee under the leadership of martin dies pilloried hundreds of decent patriotic citizens </s>
<s> anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government </s>
<s> this hysteria reached its height under the leadership of senator joseph mccarthy </s>
<s> demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions </s>
<s> new ideas were dangerous and must be repressed no matter how </s>
<s> those who would suppress dangerous thoughts credit ideas with high potency </s>
<s> they seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new </s>
<s> hence the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe </s>
<s> despite this danger however we are informed on every hand that ideas not machines are our finest tools </s>
<s> they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page </s>
<s> so all-important are ideas we are told that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes those who invent new ideas of their own and those who borrow beg or steal from others </s>
<s> that however may also bring the police if the thinking does not meet with social approval </s>
<s> criminals as well as model citizens exercise their minds </s>
<s> merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration </s>
<s> of course there must be clarity a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones </s>
<s> but clarity is not enough </s>
<s> the writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in st joseph missouri </s>
<s> an inmate a former university professor expounded to us logically and clearly that someone was pilfering his thoughts </s>
<s> he appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done </s>
<s> despite the clarity of his presentation his idea was not of einsteinian calibre </s>
<s> ideas we must have and we seek them everywhere </s>
<s> we scour literature for them </s>
<s> here we find stored the wisdom of great minds </s>
<s> shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of shylock but probably he never saw a jew unless in some of his travels </s>
<s> if any had escaped expulsion by hiding they certainly would not frequent the market-place </s>
<s> shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays but borrowed them from old stories ballads and plays wove them together and then breathed into them his spark of life </s>
<s> he could learn at second hand from books but could not thus capture the real jewish spirit </s>
<s> he took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone </s>
<s> the jew was the safest victim </s>
<s> no jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater </s>
<s> it would have been unwise policy for instance to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman </s>
<s> just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of mars or even of tikopia and no senatorial investigation will result </s>
<s> who cares about them </s>
<s> shakespeare does not tell us that shylock was an aberrant individual </s>
<s> he sets him forth as being typical of the group </s>
<s> but a jewish heart </s>
<s> this would make anyone crafty and cruel capable of fiendish revenge </s>
<s> there is no justification for such misrepresentation </s>
<s> if living jews were unavailable for study the bible was at hand </s>
<s> reading the old testament would have shown the dramatist that the ideas attributed to shylock were abhorrent to the jews </s>
<s> studying the merchant of venice in high school and college has given many young people their notions about jews </s>
<s> thomas de torquemada inquisitor-general of the spanish inquisition put many persons to death </s>

<s> let his bones and his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong </s>

<s> ideas in and of themselves are not necessarily the greatest good </s>
<s> a successful businessman recently prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where they and their theories might rot together </s>
<s> frequently we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive </s>
<s> in the same vein a certain short-story plot has been overworked </s>
<s> the son and heir of a prominent family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of her finger nails </s>
<s> in time she presents her aristocratic husband with a coal-black child </s>
<s> for answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists the biologists the historians the psychologists and the sociologists </s>
<s> long ago they consigned the notions of kyne and dixon to the scrap heap </s>
<s> false ideas surfeit another sector of our life </s>
<s> for several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship </s>
<s> the stepmother almost without exception has been presented as a cruel ogress </s>
<s> children conditioned by this mistaken notion have feared stepmothers while adults by their antagonistic attitudes have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one </s>
<s> debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild a happier one </s>

<s> most assuredly ideas are invaluable </s>
<s> but ideas just for the sake of having them are not enough </s>
<s> for a time the president received hundreds of them every day most of them worthless </s>
<s> ideas need to be tested and not merely by argument and debate </s>
<s> when some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer for instance we do not turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign </s>
<s> we have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory </s>
<s> the merits of the salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children </s>
<s> our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument </s>
<s> man we are told is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from bad </s>
<s> but what a super-herculean task it is to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely particularly since such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes in themselves declarations of intellectual bankruptcy </s>
<s> we are reminded however that freedom of thought and discussion the unfettered exchange of ideas is basic under our form of government </s>
<s> assuredly in our political campaigns there is freedom to think to examine any and all issues and to speak without restraint </s>
<s> no holds are barred </s>
<s> we must not forget to be sure that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results </s>
<s> in truth we can say that this broke the power of senator joseph mccarthy who was finally exposed in full light to the american people </s>
<s> debate in the political arena can be productive of good </s>
<s> but it is a clumsy and wasteful process it can produce negative results but not much that is positive </s>
<s> debate rid us of mccarthy but did not give us much that is positive </s>
<s> it did something to clear the ground but it erected no striking new structure </s>
<s> in the field of the natural sciences scientifically verified data are quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good results </s>
<s> in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage </s>
<s> by no means would we discourage the production of ideas they provide raw materials with which to work </s>
<s> they provide stimulations that lead to further production </s>
<s> we would establish no censorship </s>
<s> and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make it a successorship by inheritance </s>
<s> it is testimony to the deep respect in which mr eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not explicitly to be broached </s>
<s> and if howard rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession his article in the atlantic monthly accomplished a good deal more </s>
<s> it forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentators had been placed </s>
<s> because the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the president rather than with his doctors nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure </s>
<s> for the president had dealt with the matter humbly in what he conceived as the democratic way </s>
<s> but the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man rather than a group of men whether a group of doctors a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion or the masses of the voters </s>
<s> it was a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in attempts at prediction </s>
<s> in no other situation would a group of doctors struggling competently to improve the life expectancy of a man beloved by the world be subjected to such merciless and persistent questioning and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problems it faces </s>
<s> and though we can look back now and see their errors we can look back also to the ultimate error </s>
<s> the press conference became a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking rather than his convictions </s>
<s> he gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any renewed question about his running as in the battle of the bulge he had no fears about the outcome until he read the american newspapers </s>
<s> yet the attitude that the fate of the presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battles to be fought regardless of the consequences </s>
<s> in this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears </s>
<s> the presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications of the death of any incumbent </s>
<s> only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the dangers of his death </s>
<s> ironically enough in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury </s>
<s> at the national and international level then what is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political immorality </s>
<s> and we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us </s>
<s> nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than the peculiar editorial page appearing in a july issue of life magazine the issue which also carried the second announcement of the candidacy </s>
<s> but by the time the risk was doubled events had dismissed from his mind both increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza </s>
<s> only infrequently did the situation color his thinking </s>
<s> ironically no president we have had would have regretted more than president eisenhower the possibility to which his own words in the press conference held at the beginning of august testified that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country unconsciously he had placed his party before his nation </s>
<s> so it is that we relive his opening statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy of the present </s>
<s> no consideration of risk urges itself upon him now for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not properly focussed </s>
<s> yet with a mind less shallow if less sharp than some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him he feels what he cannot formulate </s>
<s> and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters </s>
<s> moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him he adopts a position that is morally indefensible </s>
<s> as a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place the statement is an effective one we sympathize with the universal confusion which gives rise to such convictions </s>
<s> but it is also the climax to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history </s>
<s> in assigning to god the responsibility which he learned could not rest with his doctors eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration in the years to follow </s>
<s> in any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have caused us a profound moral shock </s>
<s> about this man we had to think twice </s>
<s> we knew that it was as reassurance the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature </s>
<s> but the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major decisions and thus for imposing his will on the people </s>
<s> and in the context of drifting personal utterances we have examined there was occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions </s>
<s> when the possibility that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision seemed to disconcert his questioners mr eisenhower was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more </s>
<s> thinking had stopped </s>
<s> it was not to be resumed </s>
<s> the portrait that had developed fragmentarily but consistently was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits when it does not forestall any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence </s>
<s> this does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been revoked </s>
<s> instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered might have done </s>
<s> drifting through a third illness apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president eisenhower revealed the singularly static quality of his thinking </s>
<s> by contrast the energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the man </s>
<s> only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality in the major decision are effectively to be checked </s>
<s> in the incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail and to articulate the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant with what is sometimes astounding rapidity </s>
<s> like lincoln he can distinguish his relation to god from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable decision exacts of him </s>
<s> like roosevelt he can distinguish an attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him </s>
<s> he chooses to subordinate one to the other sometimes reluctantly accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed </s>
<s> the very nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader </s>
<s> the making of distinctions like the perception of the great distinctions made is an inordinately difficult business </s>
<s> but because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the capacities with which words endow it we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction in the sphere of politics on which decisions hang </s>
<s> for this change is not a change from one positive position to another but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation </s>
<s> the liberal-conservative division we might observe in passing is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups </s>
<s> rather it is rooted in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration </s>
<s> the division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change </s>
<s> on the most primitive level </s>
<s> for the answer cannot be derived from any socially cohesive element in the disrupting community </s>
<s> there is no socially existential answer to the question </s>
<s> for the truth formerly experienced by the community no longer has existential status in the community nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians </s>
<s> in this phase of change no idea has social acceptance and so none has ontological status in the community </s>
<s> an interregnum ensues in which not men but ideas compete for existence </s>
<s> if we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they evoke </s>
<s> the first two types of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society </s>
<s> the first involves a simple shift of interests in the society </s>
<s> the second involves something deeper but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for the community not in the truth on which the community rests </s>
<s> thus in both types attention is focused on the community itself and its phenomenological life </s>
<s> the third type however wrenches attention from the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the ground of being on which the community depends for its existence </s>
<s> voegelin has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable healthy community </s>
<s> there the community faced with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced </s>
<s> this however cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth is confused and incoherent it has no absolute standard and consequently cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent </s>
<s> it has lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances </s>
<s> relativism and equality are its characteristic diseases </s>
<s> precisely at the moment when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure itself </s>
<s> the liberal-conservative split to define it further derives from a basic difference concerning the existential status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to its identification </s>
<s> when disruptive change has penetrated to the third level of social order the process of disruption rapidly reaches a point of no return </s>
<s> indeed it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins </s>
<s> the reasons for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change </s>
<s> of all forms of being society or community has the greatest element of determinability </s>
<s> the content of that psychological status determines ultimately the content of civilization </s>
<s> those social civilizational factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group ultimately cease to exist </s>
<s> civilization is what man has made of himself </s>
<s> its massive contours are rooted in the simple need of man since he is always incomplete to complete himself </s>
<s> it is not enough for man to be an ontological esse </s>
<s> he needs existential completion he needs that is to move in the direction of completion </s>
<s> and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself </s>
<s> he must consequently exist as a self-perceived substantive developing agent or he does not exist as man </s>
<s> thus human perception and human volition is the immanent cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches the civilizational level </s>
<s> thus with regard to the loss of tradition in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works itself out as a disruption of the individual soul a change in which man continues as an objective ontological existent but no longer as a man </s>
<s> further change is a form of motion it occurs as the act of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached the terminus of the change </s>
<s> a number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process </s>
<s> change involves the displacement of form </s>
<s> this means that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring the existent form in being </s>
<s> if the existent form is to be retained new factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation </s>
<s> in the case of social decay form is displaced simply by the process of dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process </s>
<s> now in the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence of the ontological weakness of the fading form </s>
<s> and when we consider the tenuous hold tradition has on existence any weakening of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence </s>
<s> the retention of a tradition confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new spiritual forces into the situation </s>
<s> however the crisis occurs precisely as a weakening of spiritual forces </s>
<s> it would seem therefore that in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself </s>
<s> the emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory of disorder </s>
<s> and it would seem that history is a witness to this truth </s>
<s> as a further characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for escaping inevitabilities in history </s>
<s> these differences in turn derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change </s>
<s> unanalyzed responses </s>
<s> anxiety and deep insecurity are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition </s>
<s> to experience them it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it </s>
<s> the process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding within the individual while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs </s>
<s> within the individual the reaction has been called various names all however pointing to the same basic experience </s>
<s> within institutions there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one of persuasion </s>
<s> within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed responses to the experience of civilizational crisis two basic organizations of response are observable reaction and ideological progressivism </s>
<s> these responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis </s>
<s> both are predictably destined to fail </s>
<s> the response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing </s>
<s> its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive forces </s>
<s> to this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers </s>
<s> the implicit assumption of this response is that history is reversible </s>
<s> seemingly order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by adventitious accretions </s>
<s> the problem is to remove the accretions and thereby uncover the order that was always there </s>
<s> such a response of course misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence </s>
<s> moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of order once the activation of change has reached visible proportions </s>
<s> the most reaction can achieve is stasis and a stasis that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts itself </s>
<s> despite the hopelessness of the response it is explicable in terms of the crisis of tradition itself </s>
<s> since a civilizational crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class </s>
<s> their great error is to mingle the responses typical of each of the three types of change </s>
<s> since civilizational change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze it seldom is given adequate attention </s>
<s> and the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status </s>
<s> the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational </s>
<s> but this truth is distorted by its extreme application the assumption of the separate existence of tradition </s>
<s> the reactionary misses the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of psychological-intellectual relations </s>
<s> reactionary theories for this reason usually assume some form of organismic theory </s>
<s> in its defensive formulations the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community </s>
<s> in both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality </s>
<s> when the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual defense the characteristics of that defense are explicable only in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction </s>
<s> reaction is rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole </s>
<s> there is no selectivity </s>
<s> even the questionable features of the past are defended </s>
<s> the point is that the reactionary for whatever motive perceives himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself something which consequently he was not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference </s>
<s> the reactionary is confused about the existential status of a decaying tradition but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy </s>
<s> all of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work </s>
<s> a man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat his earliest failure in love only makes us a little weary of man </s>
<s> his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial </s>
<s> now we can argue that the irresistible fate of oedipus rex was nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longings of oedipus projected outward but this externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history </s>
<s> but a novel in which one man karamazov explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the psychoanalytic quarterly </s>
<s> it is a mistake to look upon the oedipus of oedipus complex as a literary descendant of oedipus rex </s>
<s> whatever the psychological truth in the oedipus myth an oedipus who is drawn to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its archaic crime and the incest that is unknowing renews the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the secret </s>
<s> but a modern oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose his own childhood is only pathetic and for renouncing the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies </s>
<s> i am suggesting that a case-history approach to the oedipus complex is a blind alley for a storyteller </s>
<s> the best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises the novelist may have in store for him </s>
<s> incest is still a durable theme but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions and there is no better way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation </s>
<s> and the best way to conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out to write an incest story </s>
<s> which brings to mind another lawrence story and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the oedipal theme </s>
<s> if i now risk some comparisons with sons and lovers let it be clear that i am not comparing the two works or judging their merits </s>
<s> i am only singling out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects </s>
<s> it is the story of the hopeless love of a little boy for his cold and vain mother </s>
<s> there are ghostly scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse </s>
<s> the child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother </s>
<s> the child dies with his mourning mother at his bedside </s>
<s> i had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did </s>
<s> but on one occasion when i encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient i began to understand the uncanny effects of this story </s>
<s> the rocking is actually felt in the story a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesies the tragedy </s>
<s> the rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent silent and making it present </s>
<s> it conceals and yet is suggestive </s>
<s> a perfect symbol </s>
<s> and if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy </s>
<s> for this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden love doomed by its nature </s>
<s> this love belongs to childhood </s>
<s> i am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood </s>
<s> it is most probable that freud and the oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing of this story </s>
<s> he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged </s>
<s> he would not have cared why it emerged he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy </s>
<s> the young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge </s>
<s> he has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights </s>
<s> he has been seduced by the marvels of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character </s>
<s> if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior that the ego is still the executive agency of personality and that all we know of personality must be discerned through the ego </s>
<s> the novelist who has been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that since all men must have an oedipus complex all men must have the same faces </s>
<s> i have argued that oedipus of the oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature </s>
<s> moral dread is seen as the other face of desire and here psychoanalysis delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem of great complexity </s>
<s> there is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories i have encountered in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth </s>
<s> the ancient types are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their destinies but the myth fails before the modern truth </s>
<s> the oracle speaks false and the dream speaks true </s>
<s> the heroic act is the casting off of pretense </s>
<s> he chose a medieval legend of incest gregorius vom stein and freely borrowed and parodied other myths of the west mixing themes language peoples and times in a master myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves as in his previous treatment of joseph </s>
<s> mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell </s>
<s> and when he retold the legend of gregorius he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in archaic language </s>
<s> while they move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through not-knowing they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the twentieth-century manner </s>
<s> grigorss is the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister the twins sibylla and wiligis </s>
<s> he is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast adrift soon after birth </s>
<s> the infant is discovered by a fisherman who brings him home to rear him </s>
<s> grigorss at seventeen learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his origins </s>
<s> grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle delivers the city from its oppressors and marries sibylla who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him </s>

<s> helion did not realize it at the time but it was true </s>

<s> abstract art was still the right path for him </s>

<s> after a year in a studio on sheridan square having married an american girl who was a native of virginia helion moved to a village in the blue ridge mountains where he produced some of the most imposing of his abstract canvases </s>
<s> the darkening world scene at the time of the munich pact continued to trouble his mind even in his remote virginia studio </s>
<s> in haste he labored to finish some last abstract paintings a three-panel frieze with a flying figure and a fallen figure </s>
<s> with those paintings of big constructions crashing down he felt he could stop </s>
<s> they were in effect his last testament to non-objective art </s>
<s> he had taken out first papers for american citizenship </s>
<s> its first apparition was a long gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons or pushing prams </s>
<s> his company then carried out a confused retreating movement until it was surrounded by the germans a few days before france capitulated </s>
<s> after a sort of death march during four days without food helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp at an estate farm in east germany </s>
<s> a year later they were removed to a stalag in the harbor of stettin </s>
<s> when he was stripped deloused and numbered by his guards his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners goods to be confiscated </s>

<s> in secret he also acted as a member of the prisoners central committee which plotted sabotage planned a few escapes and maintained a hidden control over the wretched french slave-laborers </s>
<s> in the stalag helion came to know and love his comrades most of them plain folk who in their extremity showed true courage and ran great risks to help each other </s>
<s> how much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape </s>
<s> during long weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed </s>
<s> every morning contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories </s>
<s> their sentry followed </s>

<s> duclos ran toward desprez with fists raised </s>
<s> shedding his prison cloak helion shot through the gates now clad in civilian garments and with the passport of a flemish worker </s>
<s> to escape from a prison camp required a very special state of mind </s>
<s> not only loathing of captivity but a faith a hope that is even stronger </s>
<s> i left behind me brave men whom captivity had robbed of all hope </s>
<s> it was a time of revelations for him </s>
<s> even the most rational of men under great stress may be transported by a new faith and behave like mystics </s>
<s> in prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life his guards his companions in misery </s>
<s> before leaving for america he happened to see his old friend jean arp and confided to him his new resolutions </s>
<s> it was very widely read too </s>
<s> but when he showed his new figurative pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp they paid him no compliments and drew long faces </s>
<s> these new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most hence associated with the sense of lost freedom the cafe at the corner the newspaper kiosk the girls in doorways and windows along the street the golden-crusted french bread they lacked the cigarettes denied them </s>
<s> one of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette </s>

<s> if he is a traditionalist he is an eclectic traditionalist </s>
<s> if he condemns the recent or the present he condemns the past with no less force </s>
<s> faulkner is a most untraditional traditionalist </s>
<s> that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions of course that he is steeped in them in fact or that he has dealt with them in his books </s>
<s> he has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed southern </s>
<s> the fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less southern i rather think for the south has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity </s>
<s> some of us might be inclined to argue in fact that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation either mental or physical are particularly southern traits </s>
<s> there is no necessity i suppose to assert that mr faulkner is southern </s>
<s> it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his family </s>
<s> and after all he has lived comfortably at both oxford mississippi and charlottesville virginia </s>
<s> besides showing no inclination apparently to absent himself from his native region even for short periods and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region he has handled in those books an astonishingly complete list of matters which have been important in the south during the past hundred years </s>
<s> it is more difficult with faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge </s>
<s> his own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the south implying that what he knows of that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own unassisted observation </s>
<s> his denials of extensive reading notwithstanding it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time schooling himself in southern history and that he has gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived in the south or have written about the south </s>
<s> to believe otherwise would be unrealistic </s>
<s> but in looking at faulkner against his background in mississippi and the south it is important not to lose the broader perspective </s>
<s> his earliest work reflected heavy influences from english and continental writers </s>
<s> evidence is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the gothic romancers who deal in extravagant horror to the symbolists writing at the end of the preceding century and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelists henry james and james joyce among them </s>
<s> his repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence of mind and an originality of approach but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him </s>
<s> a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made i think by noting briefly how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has deviated from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region </s>
<s> the thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society did not come however until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed </s>
<s> as they looked with nostalgia to a society which had been swept away they were probably no more than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed </s>
<s> their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the south even while memories of the war were still sharp </s>
<s> the myth of the southern plantation has had only a tangential relation with actuality as francis pendleton gaines showed forty years ago and i suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed </s>
<s> faulkner has found it useful but he has employed it with his habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook </s>
<s> it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of ellen glasgow who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of planter society </s>
<s> the chief literary antecedents of the snopes clan appeared in the realistic humorous writing which originated in the south and the southwest in the three decades before the civil war </s>
<s> these narratives of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers as a rule and later found their way between book covers though rarely into the planters libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes of horace mr addison mr pope and sir walter scott </s>
<s> william gilmore simms sturdy realist that he was pleaded for a natural robustness such as he found in his favorites the great elizabethans to vivify the pale writings being produced around him </s>
<s> simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully </s>
<s> augustus baldwin longstreet a preacher and a college and university president in four southern states published the earliest of these backwoods sketches and in the character ransy sniffle in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters he set an example followed by many after him </s>
<s> others who wrote of low characters and low life included thomas bangs thorpe creator of the big bear of arkansas and tom owen the bee-hunter </s>
<s> johnson jones hooper whose character simon suggs bears a close kinship to flem snopes in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will </s>
<s> and george washington harris whose tennessee hillbilly character sut lovingood perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature </s>
<s> such a comparison reminds us that in employing low characters in his works faulkner is recording actuality in the south and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent </s>
<s> such characters with their low existence and often low morality produce humorous effects in his novels and tales as they did in the writing of longstreet and hooper and harris but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than they had in the earlier writers </s>
<s> nor is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters </s>
<s> one of the early humorists already mentioned thomas bangs thorpe can be used to illustrate another point where faulkner touches authentic southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials </s>
<s> thorpe came to louisiana from the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and idealized beauty </s>
<s> but thorpe saw also the hardships of pioneer existence the cultural poverty of the frontier settlements and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions </s>
<s> as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of hardscrabble arkansas where no one had ever seen a piano </s>
<s> as a humanist dr huxley interests himself in the possibilities of human development and one thing we can say about this suggestion which comes from a leading zoologist is that so far as he is concerned the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution </s>

<s> there may be a case of this sort but it is not one we wish to argue here </s>

<s> not only did constellations like draco cepheus and cassiopeia spin circles around the pole but stars which were not circumpolar rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night </s>
<s> this was clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after noon </s>
<s> ships disappear hull-first over the horizon </s>
<s> approaching shore their masts appeared first </s>
<s> earth being at the center of the universe would have the same shape as the latter </s>
<s> so eg did aristotle argue although this may not be an observational reason in favor of circularity </s>
<s> the discoid shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things </s>
<s> in light of all this one would require special reasons for saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular </s>
<s> there were no reasons for such suppositions then </s>
<s> this conjoined with the considerations above made the circular motions of heavenly bodies appear an almost directly observed fact </s>
<s> additional philosophical considerations advanced notably by aristotle supported further the circularity principle </s>
<s> it must apparently be motion without termini </s>
<s> circular motion however since it is eternal and perfectly continuous lacks termini </s>
<s> it is never motion towards something </s>
<s> only imcomplete imperfect things move towards what they lack </s>
<s> perfect complete entities if they move at all do not move towards what they lack </s>
<s> they move only in accordance with what is in their natures </s>

<s> let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between ptolemaic and copernican astronomy </s>
<s> bluntly there never was a ptolemaic system of astronomy </s>
<s> copernicus achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy </s>
<s> they all have this in common the earth is situated near the center of the deferent </s>
<s> he might even suppose the planets to move at infinity </s>
<s> his problem concerns longitudes latitudes and angular velocities </s>
<s> the distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master beyond crude conjectures as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth </s>
<s> but none of this has prevented scientists philosophers and even historians of science from speaking of the ptolemaic system in contrast to the copernican </s>
<s> this is a mistake </s>
<s> it is engendered by confounding the aristotelian cosmology in the almagest with the geocentric astronomy </s>
<s> ptolemy recurrently denies that he could ever explain planetary motion </s>
<s> this is what necessitates the nonsystematic character of his astronomy </s>
<s> it is the chief merit in copernicus work that all his planetary calculations are interdependent </s>
<s> he cannot describe eclipses without entertaining some form of a three-body problem </s>
<s> in ptolemaic terms however eclipses and retrograde motion were phenomena simpliciter to be explained directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations </s>
<s> in a systematic astronomy like that of copernicus retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system </s>
<s> they are no longer a puzzling aspect of intricately variable local planetary motions </s>
<s> another contrast stressed when discussing ptolemaic vs copernican astronomy turns on the idea of simplicity </s>
<s> it is often stated that copernican astronomy is simpler than ptolemaic </s>
<s> some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former </s>
<s> copernicus by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen </s>
<s> historical records indicate that copernicus was unaware of the fundamental aspects of his so-called revolution unaware perhaps of its historical importance he rested content with having produced a simpler scheme for prediction </s>
<s> as an illustration of the principle of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be arithmetized </s>
<s> without careful qualification this can be misleading </s>
<s> but no single planetary problem ever required of ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time </s>
<s> this of course results from the non-systematic cellular character of ptolemaic theory </s>
<s> calculations within the copernican framework always raised questions about planetary configurations </s>
<s> these could be met only by considering the dynamical elements of several planets at one time </s>
<s> this is more ambitious than ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems </s>
<s> thus in no ordinary sense of simplicity is the ptolemaic theory simpler than the copernican </s>
<s> the latter required juggling several elements simultaneously </s>
<s> but simplicity here refers to systematic simplicity </s>
<s> the number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple theories is reduced to a minimum </s>
<s> the axioms required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced rigorously back to these axioms rules and primitive notions </s>
<s> there are in the almagest no rules for determining in advance whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with abberations in lunar solar or planetary behavior </s>
<s> the strongest appeal of the copernican formulation consisted in just this ideally the justification for dealing with special problems in particular ways is completely set out in the basic rules of the theory </s>
<s> the lower-level hypotheses are never ad hoc never introduced ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum </s>
<s> de revolutionibus is not just a collection of facts and techniques </s>
<s> it is an organized system of these things </s>
<s> solving astronomical problems requires for copernicus not a random search of unrelated tables but a regular employment of the rules defining the entire discipline </s>
<s> hence noting the simplicity achieved in copernicus formulation does not provide another reason for the acceptance of de revolutionibus another reason beyond its systematic superiority </s>
<s> it provides exactly the same reason </s>
<s> it is really the funeral day of scholastic science </s>
<s> but considered within technical astronomy a different pattern can be traced </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> copernicus required a systematically integrated physically intelligible astronomy </s>
<s> his objective was essentially to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends </s>
<s> the latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies </s>
<s> without abandoning too much copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable </s>
<s> he did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution </s>
<s> his feeling always exacted sacrifices from her </s>
<s> one is so accustomed to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive and women as submissive and yielding that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned and we condemn the woman as a coquette </s>
<s> the very firmness of her convictions and logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts </s>
<s> usually this is most exasperating to men who expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her sex and when she does not immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly </s>
<s> she had the opportunity that few clever women can resist of showing her superiority in argument over a man </s>
<s> women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities of a stronger will even when their affections are withheld </s>
<s> she was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done </s>
<s> one who invites such trials of character is either foolhardy overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith in mankind to see the danger </s>
<s> in any case but the last such a course is sure to avenge itself upon the individual </s>
<s> the moral powers no more than the physical and mental can bear overstraining </s>
<s> and in the last case a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding nature </s>
<s> henrietta was discovering in the process of writing as the born writer does not merely a channel for the discharge of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation insight and intuition </s>
<s> and she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of judas maccabeus performed at the hanukkah festival which came in december </s>
<s> by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that papa and mamma gave her a life of dickens as a spur to her aspiration </s>
<s> another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of johns hopkins university within walking distance of home </s>
<s> it was established in a couple of buildings in the shopping district with only a few professors but all eminent men and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings </s>
<s> and although it was a school for men only it afforded henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures </s>
<s> in the following year her father undertook to give a course in hebrew theology to johns hopkins students and this brought to the szold house a group of bright young jews who had come to baltimore to study and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by mamma and entertained by henrietta and rachel who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on sunday evenings </s>
<s> from philadelphia came cyrus adler and joseph jastrow </s>
<s> a smart shrewd and ambitious young man well connected and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people he was bound to go far </s>
<s> joseph jastrow the younger son of the distinguished rabbi marcus jastrow was a friendly round-faced fellow with a little mustache whose field was psychology and who was also a punster and a jolly tease </s>
<s> his father was a good friend of rabbi szold and joe lived with the szolds for a while </s>
<s> both these youths who greatly admired henrietta were somewhat younger than she as were also the neighboring friedenwald boys who were then studying medicine </s>
<s> and when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and papa did </s>
<s> one thing papa had not taught henrietta was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as herself </s>
<s> but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters or from coming to spend his christmas vacations with the hospitable lively szolds in their pleasant house on lombard street </s>
<s> and the szold family as it developed bore a striking resemblance to the marches </s>
<s> mr march like benjamin szold was a clergyman although of an indeterminate denomination </s>
<s> but the march girls had their counterparts in the szold girls </s>
<s> henrietta could easily identify herself with jo march although jo was not the eldest sister </s>
<s> but both were high-spirited and vivacious both had tempers to control both loved languages especially english and german both were good teachers and wrote for publication </s>
<s> and each stood out conspicuously in the family picture </s>
<s> when her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism sadie learned to write with her left hand </s>
<s> sadie studied piano </s>
<s> adele like amy the youngest of the marches was the rebellious mischievous rather calculating and ambitious one </s>
<s> the szolds like the marches enjoyed and loved living together even in troubled times </s>
<s> and as in the march home any young man who called on the szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them </s>
<s> this included mamma jolly generous and pretty with whom they all fell in love just as papa had first fallen in love with her mamma before he chose her </s>
<s> and when a young man like morris jastrow had enjoyed the szold hospitality he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to henrietta in whom he was really interested but to all the szold girls and mamma </s>
<s> this time he was making no mistake </s>
<s> almost from that day until his death olgivanna was to stay at his side </s>
<s> but the years that immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying both for wright and his montenegrin lady </s>
<s> it must be granted that the flouting of convention no matter how well intentioned one may be is sure to lead to trouble or at least to the discomfort that goes with social disapproval </s>
<s> even so many of the things that happened to wright and olgivanna seem inordinately severe </s>
<s> their afflictions centered on one maddening difficulty miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for </s>
<s> reporters began to trail miriam everywhere and to encourage her to make appalling statements about wright and his doings </s>
<s> flocks of writs attachments and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air </s>
<s> the distracted miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative then change her mind and make another attack on wright as a person </s>
<s> at last her lawyer arthur d cloud gave up the case because she turned down three successive settlements he arranged </s>
<s> so i got out </s>
<s> mrs wright is without funds </s>
<s> the first thing to do is get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final disposition of the case </s>
<s> but every time i suggested this to her mrs wright turned it down and demanded that i go out and punish mr wright </s>
<s> miriam noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor and appointed a heavy-faced young man named harold jackson to take his place </s>
<s> there were three years of this strange warfare </s>
<s> and during the unhappy time miriam often would charge that wright and olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of wisconsin </s>
<s> yet somehow when officers were prodded into visiting taliesin to execute the warrants they would find neither wright nor olgivanna at home </s>
<s> to get an idea of the embarrassment and chagrin that was heaped upon wright and olgivanna we should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by miriam in person </s>
<s> one of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at spring green toward the end of the open warfare on a beautiful day in june </s>
<s> at this time miriam noel appeared urging on constable henry pengally whose name showed him to be a descendant of the welsh settlers in the neighborhood </s>
<s> a troop of reporters brought up the rear </s>
<s> miriam was stopped at the taliesin gate and william weston now the estate foreman came out to parley </s>
<s> he said that mr wright was not in and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant that miriam was waving in the air </s>
<s> i think you had better leave </s>
<s> in the silence that followed miriam walked close to mrs cupply who drew back a step on her side of the gate </s>
<s> the animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force </s>
<s> and it gave miriam noel a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art </s>
<s> as if to make certain that wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him </s>
<s> she also went to washington and appealed to senator george william norris of nebraska the fighting liberal from whose office a sympathetic but cautious harrumphing was heard </s>
<s> under this kind of pressure it is not surprising that wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers </s>
<s> first wright said he was choked by the smoke which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town </s>
<s> he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty and began to talk trenchant sense though private anguish showed through in the vehemence of his manner </s>
<s> spread everything out </s>
<s> the first news stories had it that this blaze was started by a bolt of lightning as though miriam could call down fire from heaven like a prophet of the old testament </s>
<s> a storm did take place that night and fortunately enough it included a cloudburst that helped put out the flames </s>
<s> later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting the fire </s>
<s> a series of conferences with friends and bankers began about this time </s>
<s> and the question before these meetings was here is a man of international reputation and proved earning power </s>
<s> as he made plans for the new taliesin wright also got on paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation of all faiths and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping ramp </s>
<s> years were to pass before these plans came off the paper and wright was justified in thinking as the projects failed that much of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except by visitors to taliesin </s>
<s> and now there was some question as to his continued residence there </s>
<s> this might put wright in such a bad light before a court that miriam would be awarded taliesin </s>
<s> miriam sniffed at this and complained that wright had said unkind things about her to reporters </s>
<s> then miriam varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending and asking for divorce on the grounds of cruelty with the understanding that wright would not contest it </s>
<s> he said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment could be brought to an end and that the bank would accept a mortgage on taliesin to help bring this about </s>
<s> next day word came that miriam was not going through with the divorce </s>
<s> but wright stayed in the united states </s>
<s> his mentioning of japan and holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking </s>
<s> no matter what troubles might betide him this most american of artists knew in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land </s>
<s> in a few weeks miriam made another sortie at taliesin but was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates </s>
<s> more likely you simply told yourself as you handed us the book that it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline of incantation </s>
<s> besides that particular message does no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood </s>
<s> but what you could not know of course was how smoothly the victorian fitzgerald was to lead into an american fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents were to come if not of age then into a bright taut semblance of it </s>
<s> i do not suppose you ever heard of f scott fitzgerald living or dead and moreover i do not suppose that even if you had his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval </s>
<s> neither his appetites his exacerbations nor his despair were kin to yours </s>
<s> he might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him </s>
<s> but he was no man in the moon to me </s>
<s> although his tender nights were not the ones i dreamed of nor was it for yachts sports cars tall drinks and swimming pools nor yet for money or what money buys that i burned i too was burning and watching myself burn </s>
<s> the flame was simply of a different kind </s>
<s> one should not of course pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume to linger on </s>
<s> yet this passion for passion now that i look back on it with passion spent seems somewhat overblown and operatic though as a diva miss millay perfectly controlled her notes </s>
<s> perhaps this is not so little </s>
<s> one can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend </s>
<s> one can take it as no more than another veil torn from the mystery of the soul </s>
<s> but it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum </s>
<s> one could see this chemical determinant as in itself a miracle </s>
<s> but all this i am well aware is the bel canto of love and although i have always liked to think that it was to the bel canto and to that alone that i listened i know well enough that it was not </s>
<s> if i am to speak the whole truth about my knowledge of love i will have to stop trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale </s>
<s> there is another side of love more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug </s>
<s> i recoil from the very thought </s>
<s> at the same time i am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign since theirs is a science of paradox if one hates they say it is because one loves </s>
<s> if one bullies they say it is because one is afraid </s>

<s> you probably would not remember since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as i much less their intensity one sunny midday on fifth avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance at the farm </s>
<s> i can see us now </s>
<s> we had been walking quite briskly for despite your being so small and me so tall your stride in those days could easily match mine </s>
<s> if you had screamed right there in the street where we stood i could not have felt more fear </s>
<s> with scarcely a mumble of excuse i fled </s>
<s> i had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal </s>
<s> what i fled from was my fear of what unwittingly you might betray without meaning to about my father and yourself </s>
<s> but i can see from this latest trick of memory how much more arbitrary and influential it is than the will </s>
<s> while my memory holds with relentless tenacity as i cannot too often stress to my wrongs when it comes to my shames it gestures and jokes and toys with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from them </s>
<s> but i will not skip it or cut it out </s>
<s> it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings of chance </s>
<s> but the time came when i was no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless </s>
<s> helpless in that sense i can never be again </s>
<s> however i confess my hope that i will be innocent again not with a pristine accidental innocence but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone </s>
<s> for innocence of all the graces of the spirit is i believe the one most to be prayed for </s>
<s> it assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best and when they seem worst it overlooks them </s>
<s> to innocence a word given is a word that will be kept </s>
<s> instinctively innocence does unto others as it expects to be done by </s>
<s> but when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust innocence can falter since its strength is according to the strength of him who possesses it </s>
<s> the innocence of which i speak is i know not incorruptible </s>
<s> but i insist upon believing that even when it is lost it may like paradise be regained </s>
<s> however it was not of innocence in general that i was speaking but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of it which is innocence in romantic love </s>
<s> here if anywhere it is not wholly incontrovertible </s>
<s> but to me innocence is far less tangible </s>
<s> i had long since begun to lose my general innocence when i lost my trust in you but this special innocence i lost before ever i loved through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience a flaming delight that had nothing nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking let alone with love </s>
<s> i knew this knowledge to be corrupting at the time i acquired it </s>
<s> today these many years later after all the temptations resisted or yielded to the weasel satisfactions and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured i call it corrupting still </s>

<s> not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries </s>
<s> we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them </s>
<s> we and our friends are of course concerned with self-defense </s>
<s> growing out of this concern is the realization that all people of the free world have a great stake in the progress in freedom of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations </s>
<s> these peoples desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels of living must not by our neglect be forced to seek help from and finally become virtual satellites of those who proclaim their hostility to freedom </s>
<s> but they must have technical and investment assistance </s>
<s> this is a problem to be solved not by america alone but also by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help </s>
<s> no longer is the united states the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries </s>
<s> to remain secure and prosperous themselves wealthy nations must extend the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will inspire hope confidence and progress </s>

<s> our surplus from foreign business transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas to finance private investment and to provide assistance to the less developed nations </s>
<s> continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would over time impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the free world </s>
<s> we must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world trade </s>
<s> further we must induce all industrialized nations of the free world to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate </s>
<s> this co-operation in this matter will provide both for the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further increases in mutually profitable trade </s>
<s> moreover progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned </s>
<s> there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane </s>
<s> but just as we drew on europe for assistance in our earlier years so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith and determination deserve help </s>

<s> here in two nations alone are almost five hundred million people all working and working hard to raise their standards and in doing so to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty </s>
<s> i cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that in our own and free world interest we must co-operate with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions as expressed in their different multi-year plans </s>
<s> through the world bank and other instrumentalities as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help we must squarely face this titanic challenge </s>
<s> i shall continue to urge the american people in the interests of their own security prosperity and peace to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and cheerfully supported </s>
<s> free world decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom </s>
<s> other countries some of which i visited last month have similar needs </s>
<s> a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared to assist in the development effort </s>
<s> during the past year i have discussed this matter with the leaders of several western nations </s>
<s> because of its wealth of experience the organization for european economic cooperation could help with the initial studies needed </s>
<s> the goal is to enlist all available economic resources in the industrialized free world especially private investment capital </s>
<s> no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined </s>
<s> if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a high state of economic advancement we will make brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom </s>
<s> otherwise the outlook could be dark indeed </s>
<s> we face indeed what may be a turning point in history and we must act decisively and wisely </s>
<s> as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength </s>
<s> no matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the issue of arms reduction </s>

<s> america possesses an enormous defense power </s>
<s> it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support </s>
<s> it is world-wide knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack the united states by surprise even though we might sustain great losses would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction </s>
<s> but i once again assure all peoples and all nations that the united states except in defense will never turn loose this destructive power </s>
<s> during the past year our long-range striking power unmatched today in manned bombers has taken on new strength as the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory </s>
<s> in fourteen recent test launchings at ranges of five thousand miles atlas has been striking on an average within two miles of the target </s>
<s> incidentally there was an atlas firing last night </s>
<s> from all reports so far received its performance conformed to the high standards i have just described </s>
<s> such performance is a great tribute to american scientists and engineers who in the past five years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles where america had none before </s>
<s> this year moreover growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will enter our active forces some to be armed with polaris missiles </s>
<s> these remarkable ships and weapons ranging the oceans will be capable of accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth </s>
<s> to meet situations of less than general nuclear war we continue to maintain our carrier forces our many service units abroad our always ready army strategic forces and marine corps divisions and the civilian components </s>
<s> the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process </s>
<s> it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength </s>
<s> the deployment of a portion of these forces beyond our shores on land and sea is persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies for collective security </s>
<s> moreover i have directed that steps be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to these allies </s>
<s> this is necessary for a sounder collective defense system </s>
<s> next i refer to our program in space exploration which is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research and development </s>
<s> these discoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community </s>
<s> but they are important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind </s>
<s> second our military missile program going forward so successfully does not suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engines which are necessary in distant space exploration </s>
<s> i am assured by experts that the thrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements </s>
<s> third the united states is pressing forward in the development of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space for exploration purposes </s>
<s> fourth in the meantime it is necessary to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately surrounding the earth </s>
<s> satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the globe </s>
<s> for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and aircraft </s>
<s> and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the data we seek </s>
<s> i believe it deficient in certain particulars </s>
<s> suggested improvements will be submitted to the congress shortly </s>
<s> the accomplishment of the many tasks i have alluded to requires the continuous strengthening of the spiritual intellectual and economic sinews of american life </s>
<s> the steady purpose of our society is to assure justice before god for every individual </s>
<s> we must be ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the issues of the day </s>
<s> a year ago when i met with you the nation was emerging from an economic downturn even though the signs of resurgent prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful </s>
<s> today our surging strength is apparent to everyone </s>
<s> yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders </s>
<s> among current problems that require solutions participated in by citizens as well as government are </s>
<s> the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged labor-management stalemate </s>
<s> the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture </s>
<s> the continuing threat of inflation together with the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility </s>
<s> in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection of the law </s>
<s> in the course of its inquiry it took testimony from only seven witnesses </s>
<s> it heard bang-jensen twice and his lawyer adolf a berle jr once </s>
<s> it also implied that paul bang-jensen had been irresponsible </s>
<s> the four bundled in overcoats mounted to the wind-swept roof of the un </s>
<s> there begley lit a fire in a wire basket and bang-jensen dropped four sealed envelopes into the flames </s>
<s> in one of these he said were notes on the identities of the eighty-one refugees </s>
<s> the method of destroying the evidence embarrassed paul bang-jensen </s>
<s> he knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence </s>
<s> the gross group had been formed for the express purpose of advising the secretary general </s>
<s> but by the time the papers were finally disposed of the group had informed the world of its purpose its recommendations and its belief that paul bang-jensen was not of sound mind </s>
<s> he had always done well </s>
<s> never well known but he had done his work competently </s>
<s> gross had received marshall courteously and they were discussing the case </s>
<s> gross was behind a clean-top desk only a manila folder before him </s>
<s> marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs </s>
<s> outside the office windows twenty-four stories above wall street a light rain was falling </s>
<s> gross swung his swivel chair </s>
<s> we were given a job and we carried it out and later his case was taken up by the disciplinary committee </s>
<s> supposing you or i were being accused in this manner and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work </s>
<s> no organization can carry on like that </s>
<s> you know bang-jensen was told the committee was to convey its views suggestions and recommendations to the secretary general </s>
<s> in his own words bang-jensen took it for granted that the group would report to the secretary general privately and not in public </s>
<s> gross bristled </s>
<s> for an instant he glared speechless at marshall </s>
<s> but you know bang-jensen launched an active campaign against us in the press </s>
<s> it was getting so that we the committee were being tried </s>
<s> gross shot another look at marshall </s>
<s> bang-jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance to make sure the term aberrant conduct was not libelous </s>
<s> gross paused and repeated himself </s>
<s> bang-jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession </s>
<s> he could have been blackmailed or his family might have been threatened </s>
<s> we attempted to conclude this and did so by having the papers burned </s>
<s> it was a sort of gotterdammerung affair </s>
<s> hammarskjold believes the un is an organization that settles matters in a procedural way </s>
<s> peter marshall reflected </s>
<s> as i understand it mr hammarskjold wanted outside advice </s>
<s> marshall asked </s>
<s> gross answered </s>
<s> gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings </s>
<s> one was an article on the un by alice widener from the cincinnati enquirer </s>
<s> the other was by chesly manley in the chicago daily tribune </s>
<s> gross pointed to the manley story </s>
<s> that implies that shann was on the enemy side </s>
<s> so once again shann had to argue with him about this </s>
<s> gross stopped briefly then went on </s>
<s> he has felt terrible about all this </s>
<s> it was a good report he did all he could to make it a good report </s>
<s> when i speak of how shann felt i know well </s>
<s> i think you are being unfair to take these things up now </s>
<s> it appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the hungarian situation </s>
<s> it said in part </s>
<s> the group conducting the review is not holding formal hearings </s>
<s> it wished to pursue in the course of this review questions arising from the body of material already in its possession </s>
<s> it sounded like a fair enough invitation peter marshall reflected and bang-jensen must have thought so too because on the thirteenth he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth floor of the un </s>
<s> there ernest gross further assured him </s>
<s> marshall pondered the reason for this and pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group </s>
<s> j a c robertson after serving gross one week left for england </s>
<s> fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged </s>
<s> another week passed and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage </s>
<s> the sickness was gone and after all the two young couples were on their honeymoon </s>
<s> the only lasting difficulty was the food </s>
<s> at last they concluded that the heavy full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise </s>
<s> walking was the remedy they decided but a deck full of chicken coops and pigpens was hardly suitable </s>
<s> skipping was the alternative </s>
<s> a rope was found and like children in school the missionaries skipped for hours at a time </s>
<s> finally tiring of so monotonous a form of exercise they decided to dance instead </s>
<s> it was much more fun reminding the girls of their old carefree days in the hasseltine frolics room at bradford </s>
<s> the weather turned warmer and with it came better appetites although harriet was still a little off-color </s>
<s> she could not face coffee or tea without milk and was always craving types of food that were not available aboard a sailing ship </s>
<s> by now she was sure she was going to have a baby deciding it would be born in india or burma that november </s>
<s> she was more excited than frightened at the prospect of having her first child in a foreign land </s>
<s> the crew of the caravan never failed to amaze ann who during her stay in salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language </s>
<s> she was now enjoying the voyage very much </s>
<s> even the first wave of homesickness had passed although there were moments when captain heard pointed out on his compass the direction of bradford that she felt a little twinge at her heart </s>
<s> on sundays with the permission of captain heard who usually attended with two of his officers services were held in the double cabin </s>
<s> sometimes a ship would be sighted and the caravan pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant deck </s>
<s> captain heard did not communicate with any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the united states and britain </s>
<s> as warmer temperatures were encountered ann and harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt water </s>
<s> when may came the caravan had already crossed the equator </s>
<s> they were sailing round the cape of good hope </s>
<s> the weather had turned wet and cold </s>
<s> at this time harriet wrote in a letter which after their finally landing in india was sent to her mother </s>
<s> i can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming oh what a luxury </s>
<s> i have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel and the almost intolerable smell after the rain that i have done little more than lounge on the bed for several days </s>
<s> while studying at the seminary in andover adoniram had been working on a new testament translation from the original greek </s>
<s> he had brought it along to continue during the voyage </s>
<s> there was one particular word that troubled his conscience </s>
<s> born a congregationalist he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having a few drops of water sprinkled on his head yet nowhere in the whole of the new testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized by sprinkling </s>
<s> john the baptist used total immersion in the river jordan for believers </s>
<s> even christ was baptized by this method </s>
<s> the more adoniram looked at the greek word for baptism the more unhappy he became over its true meaning </s>
<s> as was only natural he confided his searchings to ann conceding ruefully that it certainly looked as if their own congregationalists were wrong and the baptists right </s>
<s> ann was very troubled </s>
<s> by this time she had learned that it was futile to argue with her young husband yet the uncomfortable fact remained the american congregationalists were sending them as missionaries to the far east and paying their salaries </s>
<s> baptists and congregationalists in new england were on friendly terms </s>
<s> how embarrassing it would be if the newly appointed congregationalist missionaries should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace baptist teachings </s>
<s> by early june they were a hundred miles off the coast of ceylon by which time all four missionaries were hardened seafarers </s>
<s> but i hear the thunder roll </s>
<s> see the lightning flash </s>
<s> and the waves threatening to swallow up the vessel </s>
<s> ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two strange tropical birds </s>
<s> captain heard gave orders for the ship to be anchored in the bay of bengal until he could obtain the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters </s>
<s> sometimes ships waited for days for such a man but captain heard was lucky </s>
<s> next day a ship arrived with an english pilot his leadsman an english youth and the first hindu the judsons and newells had ever seen </s>
<s> ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance </s>
<s> the pilot possessed excellent skill at his calling </s>
<s> all day long the caravan slowly made her way through the difficult passages </s>
<s> next morning the caravan was out of the treacherous bay </s>
<s> slowly she moved up the hooghli river a mouth of the mighty ganges toward calcutta </s>
<s> ann was entranced with the view as were her husband and friends </s>
<s> running across the deck which was empty now that the livestock had been killed and eaten they sniffed the spice-laden breezes that came from the shore each pointing out new and exciting wonders to the other </s>
<s> they are very small and in the form of haystacks without either chimney or windows </s>
<s> they are situated in the midst of trees which hang over them and appear truly romantick </s>
<s> the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green and herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river and the natives are scattered about differently employed </s>
<s> some are fishing some driving the team and many are sitting indolently on the banks of the river </s>
<s> harriet was just as delighted </s>
<s> she was certain now that it would be no harder to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home in the big white house in haverhill </s>
<s> solid brick buildings painted dazzling white large domes and tall picturesque palms stretched as far as the eye could see while the wharves and harbor were filled with tall-masted sailing ships </s>
<s> the noise stunned her </s>
<s> crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their strange-sounding bengali tongue </s>
<s> ann pleased to see her friend happy was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of captain heard had sent on board for their enjoyment </s>
<s> though she did not then know its name this strange new fruit was a banana </s>
<s> six </s>
<s> the first act of adoniram and samuel on reaching calcutta was to report at the police station a necessity when landing in east india company territory </s>
<s> he had failed to realize that the burmese were not really treating him as the important visitor he considered himself </s>
<s> they were in fact quietly laughing at him for their king wished to have nothing to do with the western world </s>
<s> although after much trouble he did manage to get it back he discovered there was no trade to be had </s>
<s> a year later another salem ship returned from burma with a cargo of gum lacquer which nobody wanted to buy </s>
<s> after that salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly burma </s>
<s> the burmese appeared to have little knowledge of british power or any idea of trade </s>
<s> they despised foreigners </s>
<s> as for missionaries even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the christian faith to the burmans </s>
<s> unspeakable tortures or even execution might well be their fate </s>
<s> somewhat daunted the two american missionaries reached the police station where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk </s>
<s> they explained that they desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to burma could be found </s>
<s> he is answered by a confused honest englishman </s>
<s> the reasons for the whig joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government their delight at the prospect of a new war their hopes of having the tories hanged and so on </s>
<s> upon complaints from the lower house of convocation to the house of lords he was removed from the privy council his remark having been represented as a blasphemous affront to the clergy </s>
<s> on the other hand molesworth was naturally assailed in the tory press </s>
<s> on this issue then as on so many in these months steele and swift took rigidly opposed points of view </s>
<s> in answer to the crisis swift produced the publick spirit of the whigs his most extensive and bitter attack on his old friend </s>
<s> despite his defense of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in his speech before the house their efforts were successful </s>
<s> steele lost his seat in parliament and his personal quarrel with swift by now a public issue thus reached its climax </s>
<s> of all the whig tracts written in support of the succession the crisis is perhaps the most significant </s>
<s> certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate </s>
<s> in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes of current whig propaganda ranging from a criticism of the tory peace to an attack on the dismissal of marlborough </s>
<s> like burnet he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis </s>
<s> treasonable books striking at the hanoverian succession he complains are allowed to pass unnoticed </s>
<s> steele apparently professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his own good since the government was soon to use it as evidence against him in his trial before the house </s>
<s> in the final issues of the englishman which ended just as the new session of parliament began he provided his enemies with still more ammunition </s>
<s> in a few months the duke was to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the protestant succession </s>
<s> anne was furious and bolingbroke advised that the request be refused </s>
<s> oxford realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ took the opposite view for which the queen never forgave him </s>
<s> steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a plan </s>
<s> a few days after this englishman appeared defoe reported to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the duke be called over </s>
<s> but there is much here also which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift </s>
<s> thus he complains with considerable justice that the tory writers have resorted to libel instead of answering his arguments </s>
<s> his point is simply that the tories have showered him with personal satire despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of the sovereign </s>
<s> he explains that there are sometimes honorable courtiers but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not hesitate to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own avarice and ambition </s>
<s> such he implies is the case with his friend who is not really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts </s>
<s> this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared in the tory press especially the examiner </s>
<s> by now he was undergoing a fresh torrent of abuse from tory papers and pamphlets and action was being taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from parliament </s>
<s> it is filled with the usual personal abuse of steele especially of his physical appearance </s>
<s> the film they did after his return was an inconsequential bit of nothing titled out of this world a satire on the sinatra bobby-soxer craze </s>
<s> though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on </s>
<s> their first collaboration came close </s>
<s> johnny mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears </s>
<s> his second wife lillian was the mother of john h mercer </s>
<s> by the age of six young johnny indicated that he had the call </s>
<s> one day he followed the irish jasper greens the town band to a picnic and spent the entire day listening while his family spent the day looking </s>
<s> the disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy </s>
<s> but one afternoon mrs mercer met her </s>
<s> both were obviously on the way to the mercer home </s>
<s> but mrs mercer demanded more </s>
<s> young mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for both instruments </s>
<s> still he did like music making and even sang in the chapel choir of the woodberry forest school near orange virginia where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well </s>
<s> if his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have been mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect </s>
<s> from his playmates in savannah mercer had picked up along with a soft southern dialect traces also of the gullah dialects of africa </s>
<s> such speech differences made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language </s>
<s> it is however a disarming disguise or perhaps a shield for not only has mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years but also one who can function remarkably under pressure </s>
<s> he has also an extraordinary conscience </s>
<s> he died before he could completely pay off his debts </s>
<s> the check had been mailed from chicago the envelope bore no return address and the check was not signed </s>
<s> he had talked one other member of the group to stay with him but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to savannah </s>
<s> but mercer hung on living after a fashion in a greenwich village fourth-flight walk-up </s>
<s> a story no doubt apocryphal for mercer himself denies it has him sporting a monacle in those village days </s>
<s> though merely clear glass it was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories of producers </s>
<s> one day in a bar so the legend goes someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle and broke it </s>
<s> everett miller then assistant director for the garrick gaieties a theatre guild production needed a lyricist for a song he had written </s>

<s> entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged the burgeoning song writer to take a wife elizabeth meehan a dancer in the gaieties </s>
<s> while with the whiteman band mercer met jerry arlen </s>
<s> the lyric mercer remembers was tailored to fit the unusual melody </s>
<s> after leaving whiteman mercer joined the benny goodman band as a vocalist </s>
<s> mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs </s>

<s> city editor victor watson of the new york american was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious shifts of mood </s>

<s> nor were his manners barbaric </s>
<s> he was the son of a scottish father and an american jewish mother long widowed with whom he lived in a comfortable home in flushing </s>
<s> he had worked in the newspaper business since he was nineteen years old always for the hearst service </s>

<s> he supported his mother and his brother who afterwards committed suicide </s>
<s> and would you believe it vic added she likes him better than she does me </s>
<s> about the only time the hetman seemed excited was when one of his own pet ideas was born </s>
<s> he said that his information was so secret that he would not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip </s>
<s> i worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consulted several of my own well-informed sources </s>
<s> when i returned to make my report the hetman did not remember having sent me on the secret mission </s>
<s> he was busy he said in having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation </s>
<s> and i was to go to work on that odd matter </s>
<s> i shall tell of it later on </s>
<s> the hetman had a strong liking for a story any story which was to be had by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods </s>
<s> most of my stories were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me the facts and not as a rule by playing clever tricks </s>
<s> mr baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the friars </s>
<s> we fashioned beards put them on and reported to the hetman at the city desk </s>
<s> mr mccay had on a sort of emperor maximilian beard and mustache </s>
<s> this together with a derby hat and horn-rim eyeglasses gave me the appearance of a russian nihilist </s>
<s> mr watson did not have much humor in his make-up but he managed a mirthless smile </s>
<s> just then a reporter telephoned in from the bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder </s>
<s> the hetman told me to take the story over the phone and to write it </s>
<s> while i was sitting at one of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard arthur brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand </s>
<s> i thought it expedient to take off my derby my glasses and the beard </s>
<s> and also to change telephones </s>
<s> i managed to do this by the time the great ab returned to the place where he last had seen the fierce nihilist </s>
<s> he stood there staring with disbelief at the vacant desk </s>
<s> then he wrinkled his huge brow and went slowly out of the room </s>
<s> he had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression </s>
<s> he exposed the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporters nat ferber and carl helm </s>
<s> in the conduct of these and many other campaigns the hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed </s>
<s> one finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol wr hearst </s>
<s> that word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair </s>
<s> that is until i became an editor hence in his eyes a rival </s>
<s> during the next years he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the hearst service </s>
<s> it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists </s>
<s> i would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement </s>
<s> watson showed this wire to colonel van hamm </s>
<s> the colonel grunted then made a remark which might be construed in either of two ways </s>

<s> a little boy came to give the president his personal condolences and the president gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in </s>
<s> backstairs the maids cried a little over that and the standing invitation was not mentioned to mrs coolidge </s>

<s> he brought her shawls </s>
<s> dresses were short in the days of mrs coolidge and spanish shawls were thrown over them </s>
<s> he got her dozens of them </s>
<s> one shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it so she draped it over the banister on the second floor and it hung over the stairway </s>
<s> the president used to look at it with a ghost of a smile </s>
<s> mrs coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection </s>
<s> she kept the dolls on the lincoln bed </s>

<s> it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the smithsonian </s>
<s> people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist much later on </s>
<s> this is not true </s>
<s> the dress in the painting is a bright red with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side </s>

<s> he would not make a sound until the president had wakened and left for the office </s>
<s> then he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear </s>
<s> his signal was for the other dogs to come running but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch out </s>
<s> rob roy was self-appointed to accompany the president to his office every morning </s>
<s> rob roy was well aware of the importance of this mission and he would walk in front of the president looking neither to the right nor to the left </s>

<s> it was a high mark for mama </s>
<s> every first family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship </s>
<s> for the coolidges it was mr and mrs frank w stearns of boston massachusetts owners of a large department store </s>
<s> they seemed to be at the white house half the time </s>
<s> the butlers were amused because when the stearns were there the president would say grace at breakfast </s>
<s> if the stearns were not there grace would be omitted </s>
<s> the word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part </s>
<s> a new bill had been passed under harding that designated the government rather than the president as the tab-lifter for official meals </s>
<s> so the president would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting government officials to attend </s>
<s> he caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while he ate </s>
<s> mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful mr coolidge certainly made a good president </s>
<s> he knew exactly how to be colorful </s>
<s> the favorite guest of the house as far as the staff was concerned was mr wrigley the chewing gum king </s>
<s> you can imagine that he got pretty good service </s>
<s> he had been a friend of the hardings and continued to be invited by the coolidges </s>
<s> she was not an overnight guest in the white house but mr ike hoover the chief usher had mama check her fur coat when she came in and take care of her needs </s>
<s> mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies she had ever seen </s>
<s> mama was very patriotic and one of the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that flew above the white house </s>
<s> the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind and mama would mend it </s>
<s> she would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening </s>
<s> even when mrs coolidge was in mourning for her son she reached out to help other people in trouble </s>
<s> one person she helped was my brother </s>
<s> he was in and out of mount alto hospital for veterans any number of times </s>
<s> taking a personal interest she had the doctor assigned to the white house dr james coupal look emmett over </s>
<s> as a result he was sent to a hospital in arizona until his health improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the government service </s>
<s> but again there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the muggy washington weather and he had to return to the dry climate of the west to live and work </s>
<s> when mrs coolidge was in mourning she did not wear black </s>
<s> she wore grey every day and white every evening </s>
<s> mama knew that she was out of mourning when she finally wore bright colors </s>
<s> the president helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored dresses to get her started </s>
<s> she opened the boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face </s>
<s> on the social side the chore mama had at the formal receptions at the white house thrilled her the most </s>
<s> it was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs and just as the first lady stepped off the last tread mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to the blue room to greet her guests with the president </s>
<s> mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night </s>
<s> one night mama came home practically in a state of shock </s>
<s> she had stood at the bottom of the stairs as usual when mrs coolidge came down in the same dress that is now in the smithsonian to greet her guests </s>

<s> impressive as this enumeration is it barely hints at the diverse perceptions of jews collectively or individually that have been attested by their gentile environment </s>
<s> it is reasonable to affirm two propositions jews have been perceived by non-jews as all things to all men </s>
<s> some jews have in fact been all things to all men </s>
<s> they have observed correct neutrality </s>
<s> in the market place jews have in fact under various circumstances been valued customers and suppliers or clannish monopolists and cutthroat competitors </s>
<s> and so on through the roles referred to in the previous paragraph </s>
<s> diversity of perception yes </s>
<s> diversity of fact yes </s>
<s> but the two do not invariably or even typically coincide </s>
<s> conventional images of jews have this in common with all perceptions of a configuration in which one feature is held constant images can be both true and false </s>
<s> they are self-correcting in the sense that they are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against error </s>
<s> in accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors can be usefully distinguished current intelligence </s>
<s> predispositions regarding intelligence </s>
<s> general grant may have been the victim of false information in the instance reported in this book </s>
<s> if so he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed to bad information and dubious estimates of the future </s>
<s> but general grant may have been self-victimized </s>
<s> he may have entered the situation with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the press of affairs </s>
<s> predispositions in turn fall conveniently into two categories for purposes of analysis </s>
<s> to some extent predispositions are shaped by exposure to group environments </s>
<s> in some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality </s>
<s> after allowing for group exposures it is apparent that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism </s>
<s> these are personality factors </s>
<s> they include harmonies and conflicts within the whole man and mechanisms whereby inner components are more or less smoothly met </s>
<s> modern psychiatric knowledge provides us with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind </s>
<s> the foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or fall short of it </s>
<s> undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile conceptions of the jew unfolded in the present anthology is that it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination in terms of reality </s>
<s> many selections are themselves convincing contributions to this appraisal </s>
<s> undoubtedly however the significance of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest </s>
<s> speaking as a non-jew i believe that its primary contribution is in the realm of future policy </s>
<s> since we can neither undo nor redo the past we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow </s>
<s> in this domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local national and world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having some effect large or small upon gentile-jewish relations </s>
<s> i am deliberately raising the policy problems involved in gentile-jewish relations </s>
<s> comprehensive examination of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method </s>
<s> it is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions of such depth and range </s>
<s> the discussion is therefore limited to a suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy </s>
<s> as a groundwork for the proposal i give some attention to the first task enumerated above the clarification of goal </s>
<s> my reply is that i associate myself with all those who affirm that gentile-jewish relations should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity </s>
<s> the basic goal finds partial expression in the universal declaration of human rights a statement initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many religious and philosophical traditions </s>
<s> within this frame of reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the jews depend upon which jewish identity is involved as well as upon the nature of the claim the characteristics of the claimant the justifications proposed and the predispositions of the community decision makers who are called upon to act </s>
<s> if jews are identified as a religious body in a controversy that comes before a national or international tribunal it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship </s>
<s> when decision makers act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion </s>
<s> since the recognition of israel as a nation state claims are made in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body politic </s>
<s> community decision makers must make up their minds whether a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing expectations regarding members of nation states </s>
<s> the decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate to public policy regarding cultural groups </s>
<s> we know that much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that cluster around the key symbol of the jew </s>
<s> many public and private controversies will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in the mind and usage of gentile and jew </s>
<s> however in the context of legal and civic policy these controversies are less than novel </s>
<s> they involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any number of non-jewish groups </s>
<s> so far as the existing body of formal principle and procedure is concerned categorical novelties are not to be anticipated in jewish-gentile relationships </s>
<s> claims are properly disposed of according to norms common to all parties </s>
<s> it is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched within the public order of the world community or even of free commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving jews and gentiles during coming years </s>
<s> social process is always anchored in past predisposition </s>
<s> but it is perennially restructured in situations where anchors are dragged or lost </s>
<s> in conformance with the maximization principle we affirm that gentile-jewish relations will be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net advantage taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration </s>
<s> it is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions will cumulate </s>
<s> for instance imagine the situation if israel ever joins an enemy coalition </s>
<s> the formal position of americans who identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the jewish symbol is already clear </s>
<s> the future weight of informal factors cannot be so easily assessed </s>
<s> when we consider the disorganized state of the world community and the legacy of predispositions adversely directed against all who are identified as jews it is obvious that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted with increasing vigor and skill </s>
<s> during moments of intense crisis the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming </s>
<s> but their freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which they and the people around them enter the crisis </s>
<s> by the same test predispositions destructive of human personality exercise their most sinister impact with the result that men of good will are often trapped and nullified </s>
<s> among measures in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near the limit of self-control </s>
<s> we are learning how to do these things in some of the vast organized structures of modern society </s>
<s> the process can be accelerated </s>
<s> a truism is that the time to prepare for the worst is when times are best </s>
<s> during intercrisis periods the educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human beings of every age and condition </s>
<s> as more men and women are made capable of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength in future crises can be favorably affected </s>
<s> now an abiding difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach </s>
<s> and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation of the goodness of the good </s>
<s> in any case i do not intend to let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the problem of implementing good intentions </s>
<s> i assume that the number of readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is small and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding of others </s>
<s> properly used the present book is an excellent instrument of enlightenment </s>
<s> the traditional method proceeds by the technique of free association punctuated by interpretations proposed by the psychoanalytic interviewer </s>
<s> what we have in mind does have something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods by which they are sought </s>
<s> for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is necessary </s>
<s> but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame of mind </s>
<s> the relatively long and often colorful selections in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in what is said whether he responds with anger or applause </s>
<s> but simple involvement is not enough </s>
<s> self-discovery calls for an open permissive inquiring posture of self-observation </s>
<s> an advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances within himself resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around the central figure of the jew </s>
<s> two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time </s>
<s> one a reservation on the point i have just made is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking pseudo-feeling and pseudo-willing which fromm discussed in the escape from freedom </s>
<s> there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else </s>
<s> clearly what the person brings to the reading is important </s>
<s> moreover if the critic instructs his audience in what to see in a work he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking </s>
<s> if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work he is helping them to achieve their own identity </s>
<s> the second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products of today </s>
<s> in the range and variety of characters who in their literary lives get along all right with life styles one never imagined possible there is an implicit lesson in differentiation </s>
<s> and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species </s>
<s> the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be like the models he sees even more like everybody else </s>
<s> and this i think holds for values as well as life styles </s>
<s> one would need to test this proposition carefully </s>
<s> scientists often turn out to be idiosyncratic too </s>
<s> but still the proposition is worth examination </s>
<s> i do not know that this is true </s>
<s> both flugel and ranyard west deal with the development and nature of conscience as do such theologians as niebuhr and buber </s>
<s> it forms the core of many perhaps most problems of psychotherapy </s>
<s> certainly the awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence </s>
<s> probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature but the contents of conscience the code which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience available </s>
<s> this is in large part a code of behavior and a glossary of values what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it </s>
<s> in a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover how to behave how to think about this new experience how to exercise restraint </s>
<s> literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose dedication mission significance </s>
<s> men seem almost universally to want a sense of function that is a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone living or unborn close and immediate or generalized </s>
<s> feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation </s>
<s> a need so deeply planted asking for direction so to speak is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature </s>
<s> one of the most salient features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion </s>
<s> let us differentiate a few of these ideas </s>
<s> the aristotelian notion of catharsis the purging of emotion is a persistent and viable one </s>
<s> a third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional conflicts giving a sense of serenity and calm to individuals </s>
<s> it is possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion is a fifth idea </s>
<s> i take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without literature and a life enriched by it </s>
<s> richards view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety for him it constitutes in part the organization of impulses </s>
<s> a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these </s>
<s> but there is one in particular which it seems to me deserves special attention </s>
<s> in the wide range of experiences common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage more troublesome and more enduring in its effects than the control of love and hate </s>
<s> the study of literature contributes to this control in a curious way </s>
<s> the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience </s>
<s> here i do not mean catharsis the discharge of emotion </s>
<s> there is a second feature of the influences of literature good literature on emotional life which may have some special value for our time </s>
<s> perhaps it is only an analogy but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation </s>
<s> anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean </s>
<s> it is at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature </s>
<s> these are if the research is done with subtlety and skill researchable topics but the research is missing </s>
<s> one of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility that it is thought to provide </s>
<s> sensibility is a vague word covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent quality or skill </s>
<s> among other things it means perception discrimination sensitivity to subtle differences </s>
<s> both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged </s>
<s> its truth is illustrated by the skill sensitivity and general expertise of the english professor with whom one attends the theatre </s>
<s> the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment contrast the perceptual skill of english professors with that of their colleagues in discriminating among motor cars political candidates or female beauty </s>
<s> along these lines the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than i have seen </s>
<s> in a symposium and general exploration of the field of personal perception and interpersonal behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject with one possible exception </s>
<s> but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap </s>
<s> i would say too that the study of literature tends to give a person what i shall call depth </s>
<s> i use this term to mean three things a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling </s>
<s> it is the obverse of triviality shallowness emotional anaesthesia </s>
<s> i think these attributes cluster but i have no evidence </s>
<s> in fact i can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide continuous and properly guided exposure to literary art </s>
<s> we are all though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it in far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with chaucer and cimabue or even shakespeare and titian </s>
<s> by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and japanese colour-prints </s>
<s> but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place </s>
<s> one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general public of the newspaper critic and of the creative artist himself </s>
<s> there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary </s>
<s> such study may take many forms </s>
<s> the study of ideas in literature is one of these </s>
<s> of course it goes without saying that no student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene </s>
<s> he will frequently return to it </s>
<s> the continuities contrasts and similarities discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other </s>
<s> when we assert the value of such study we find ourselves committed to an important assumption </s>
<s> most students of literature whether they call themselves scholars or critics are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them </s>
<s> many will add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding </s>
<s> he may also consider ideas </s>
<s> it is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight </s>
<s> but in general we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other </s>
<s> at this point a working definition of idea is in order although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed </s>
<s> the term idea refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies of sensuous or emotional experience </s>
<s> it is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy </s>
<s> an idea let us say may be roughly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may be concerned </s>
<s> outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself including the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries </s>
<s> also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man the depravity of man and the dignity of man </s>
<s> one might indeed argue that the history of ideas in so far as it includes the literatures must center on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning </s>
<s> we need not to be sure expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature </s>
<s> an idea of the sort that we have in mind although of necessity readily available to imagination is more general in connotation than most poetic or literary images especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience </s>
<s> understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies </s>
<s> thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of its period </s>
<s> again he may discover embodied within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways </s>
<s> our understanding will very probably require both these commentaries </s>
<s> in recent years we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature and the arts although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy of religion and of the sciences </s>
<s> when these fields are surveyed together important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions primarily literary religious and philosophical but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even to some extent with science </s>
<s> such an understanding although it must seek to be sympathetic is not a matter of intuition </s>
<s> this is what was meant above by describing history as inferential </s>
<s> it is obvious that the historian who seeks to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns by no means a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research </s>
<s> the student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition which are at the same time patterns of transformation whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another </s>
<s> we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts </s>
<s> finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread </s>
<s> no one will deny that such broad developments and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to them </s>
<s> still we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology philosophy political thought and literature </s>
<s> the actual moments of contact are vitally important </s>
<s> these moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concerned </s>
<s> perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence on the western world has been that of the old and new testament </s>
<s> certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the bible </s>
<s> this reading and the comments that it evoked constitute the influence </s>
<s> a contrast of the scripture reading of let us say st augustine john bunyan and thomas jefferson all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression </s>
<s> we may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and even indirectly the scientists </s>
<s> again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating if to our minds grotesque anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural elimination of the unfit in lucretius who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher empedocles </s>
<s> here an important caveat is in order </s>
<s> if within one year you can make a success out of the american you can practically name your own salary thereafter </s>
<s> the blue-eyed watson decided that he would dislike living in new york and the deal fell through </s>
<s> hearst disclaimed blame for this but the conversation according to lane ended on a tart note </s>
<s> hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to new york to become a father </s>
<s> this was not before the house but before the judiciary committee where he asked for action on one of his pet bills that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad monopoly </s>
<s> attorney shearn had worked on this for two years and had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the united states attorney for the southern district of new york </s>
<s> six of the railroads carrying coal to tidewater from the pennsylvania fields hearst said not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright at least eleven mines </s>
<s> the congressman tried hard but failed </s>
<s> this was the very sort of legislation that roosevelt himself had in mind </s>
<s> there can be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in washington overt or implied to block anything hearst wanted even if it was something good </s>
<s> hatred tied his hands in congress </s>
<s> roosevelt and others considered him partly responsible for the murder of mckinley </s>
<s> they were repelled by his noisy newspapers his personal publicity his presumptuous campaign for the presidential nomination and by the swelling cloud of rumor about his moral lapses </s>
<s> he might get votes from his constituents but he would never get a helping hand in congress </s>
<s> he was the house pariah </s>
<s> even the regular democrats disowned him </s>
<s> inherently incapable of cooperating with others he ran his own show regardless of how many party-line democratic toes he stepped on </s>
<s> he was a political maverick a reformer with his own program determined to bulldoze it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him </s>
<s> he showed little interest in measures put forward by the regular democrats </s>
<s> he sought to run congress as he ran his new york american or journal a scheme veteran legislators resisted </s>
<s> for a freshman congressman to read political lessons to graybeard democrats was poor policy for one who needed to make friends </s>
<s> he soon quarreled with all the party leaders in the house and came to be regarded with detestation by regular democrats as a professional radical leading a small pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to party discipline </s>
<s> to old-line democrats the hearst presidential boom now in full cry was the joke of the new century </s>
<s> yet no leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant t r a semblance of a race </s>
<s> there was talk of dragging old ex-president cleveland out of retirement for another try </s>
<s> some preferred judge alton b parker of new york </s>
<s> there was a host of dark horses </s>
<s> the sneers at hearst changed to concern when it was seen that he had strong support in many parts of the country </s>
<s> platoons of hearst agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful search for delegates at the coming convention and there were charges that money was doing a large part of the persuading </s>
<s> his candidacy affected his journalism somewhat </s>
<s> this it is urged would relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the trust magnates </s>
<s> the alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the trusts for their campaign funds and in doing this will incur obligations which would make a democratic victory absolutely fruitless </s>
<s> the average democratic politician especially in the country districts is hungry for the spoils of office </s>
<s> if anything the conservative democrats were more opposed to hearst than the republicans </s>
<s> in his own state of new york the two democratic bellwethers state leader hill and tammany boss murphy were saying nothing openly against hearst but industriously boosting their own favorites murphy being for cleveland and hill for parker </s>
<s> they had lost twice with the radical bryan and were having no part of hearst whom they considered more radical than bryan </s>
<s> but his increasing strength in the west looked menacing </s>
<s> it caused henry watterson to sound a blast in his louisville courier-journal </s>
<s> but there is a hearst barrel </s>
<s> more splenetic was senator edward carmack of tennessee a parker man </s>
<s> a lone pro-hearst voice from new york city was that of william devery who had been expelled as a tammany leader but still claimed strong influence in his own district </s>
<s> our state has been overrun with a gang of paid agents and retainers </s>
<s> as for the paid hessians from other states we are here to instruct the indiana democracy in their duty i have nothing but contempt </s>
<s> the hearst dollar mark is all over them </s>
<s> in his fight for the illinois and indiana delegations hearst made several trips to chicago to confer with andrew lawrence the former san francisco examiner man who was now his chicago kingpin and once to meet with bryan </s>
<s> koenigsberg never did learn what hearst wanted for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door </s>
<s> he took the stack of mail and tossed it into the waste basket </s>
<s> hearst hopped into a private railroad car with max ihmsen and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and southern states always wearing a frock coat listening intently to local politicians and generally making a good impression </s>
<s> he laughed at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated </s>
<s> but i do not have to be bribed by office to be a democrat </s>

<s> i supported cleveland three times and bryan twice </s>
<s> this was historic in its way for it marked the first time an american presidential aspirant had advertised his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land </s>
<s> yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value </s>
<s> when nan patterson a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who had appeared in a floradora road show rode down broadway in a hansom cab with her married lover frank young she stopped the cab to disclose that young had been shot dead tearfully insisting that he had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so </s>
<s> his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities </s>
<s> military knowledge love of detail and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added ingredients </s>
<s> but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story </s>
<s> trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues connected with his subject </s>
<s> the outstanding example was in garibaldi and the thousand where he made use of unpublished papers of lord john russell and english consular materials to reveal the motives which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross the straits of messina </s>
<s> in looking back over the volumes it is possible to find errors of interpretation some of which were not so evident at the time of writing </s>
<s> thus trevelyan repeats the story which pictured victor emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous statuto at the insistence of general radetzky </s>
<s> later research has shown this part of the legend of the re galantuomo to be false </s>
<s> trevelyan accepts italian nationalism with little analysis he is unduly critical of papal and french policy and he is more than generous in assessing british policy </s>
<s> but fifty years later the trilogy still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification of italy a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at the time of publication </s>
<s> the complexities of venetian politics eluded him but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of the part played by its leading figure </s>
<s> if it is not one of his best books it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his own garibaldi </s>
<s> already trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english figures of the same period </s>
<s> first the life of john bright appeared and seven years later lord grey of the reform bill </s>
<s> of the two the life of bright is incomparably the better biography </s>
<s> yet he is right when he claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength </s>
<s> in the story of bright and the corn law agitation the crimean war the american civil war and the franchise struggle trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which enabled this independent man to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so long </s>
<s> nineteenth-century virtues however seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular </s>
<s> the biography of lord grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all </s>
<s> characteristically trevelyan enjoyed writing the work </s>
<s> the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter of discontent and repression was he has told us congenial to his artistic sense </s>
<s> but his concentration on personalities and his categorical assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation </s>
<s> for once his touch deserted him </s>
<s> research in the period of grey and bright led naturally to a more ambitious work </s>
<s> more temperately than in the study of grey and despite his liberal bias trevelyan vividly sketches the england of pre-french revolution days portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich colors and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp and clear focus </s>
<s> his technique is genuinely masterful </s>
<s> yet britain in the nineteenth century became the vade mecum of beginning students of history went through edition after edition and continues to be reprinted up to the very present </s>
<s> these lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey of english development which took form afterward as a history of england </s>
<s> in short order the general history became his most popular work and has remained aside from his later social history the work most widely favored by the public </s>
<s> the result was fortunate </s>
<s> but as a stimulating provocative interpretation of the broad sweep of english development it is incomparable </s>
<s> living pictures of the early boroughs country life in tudor and stuart times the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive surveys of language and literature the common law parliamentary development </s>
<s> the strength of the history is also its weakness </s>
<s> trevelyan is militantly sure of the superiority of english institutions and character over those of other peoples </s>
<s> his nationalism was not a new characteristic but its self-consciousness even its self-satisfaction is more obvious in a book that stretches over the long reach of english history </s>
<s> and yet the elements which capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the english story worth telling and worth remembering </s>
<s> like most major works of synthesis the history of england is informed by the positive views of a first-class mind and this is surely a major work </s>
<s> by now he had become regius professor of modern history at cambridge and had been honored by the award of the order of merit </s>
<s> his academic duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen </s>
<s> blenheim was followed in rapid succession by ramillies and the union with scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession the three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen anne </s>
<s> of the three volumes blenheim is easily the best </s>
<s> his delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly to life </s>
<s> yet as an evocation of time past there are few such successful portraits in english historical literature </s>
<s> once the scene is set trevelyan skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax in the dramatic victory of marlborough and eugene of savoy at blenheim </s>
<s> the scene is etched in sharp detail the military problems brilliantly explained and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident </s>
<s> if only for this modest masterpiece of military history blenheim is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations have perhaps altered our picture of the marlborough wars </s>
<s> ramillies and the union with scotland has fewer high spots than blenheim and much less of its dramatic unity </s>
<s> yet in several chapters on scotland in the eighteenth century trevelyan copes persuasively with the tangled confusion of scottish politics against a vivid background of scottish religion customs and traditions </s>
<s> i stood on a table surrounded by hundreds of expectant young faces </s>
<s> questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities </s>
<s> after making a short statement about human rights and the freedom to travel i told them i would be going to the kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the rhine into germany </s>
<s> called out a dozen young voices </s>
<s> that was all they needed </s>
<s> they would champion me </s>
<s> there was only one hitch the small town of kehl on the other side of the rhine was still under french jurisdiction </s>
<s> in fact all persons were permitted to cross the rhine into kehl there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river </s>
<s> alarmed by this display of weapons i looked toward the bridge and there saw stretched across the near side a cordon of policemen their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several french officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby </s>
<s> this is full evidence of your support for my principles </s>
<s> these principles however will not be served by violence in any form </s>
<s> if they are right they will prevail of and by themselves </s>
<s> i ask you all to support me in this </s>
<s> if one finger is raised against the authorities all our moral power will vanish </s>
<s> your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what i am saying </s>
<s> i have full confidence in you </s>
<s> i marched up to the waiting officials the students massed behind me </s>
<s> as usual the press photographers were on hand </s>
<s> the waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade and asked me in french if i had papers to leave france </s>
<s> i took one step eastward </s>
<s> one of the uniformed officers stepped in my way demanding to know whether i had permission to enter germany </s>
<s> i asked him </s>
<s> at this the students let out a yell knowing full well the actual frontier was beyond the town of kehl </s>
<s> the waspish man stepped forward </s>
<s> but there is no line between france and germany that is no actual line </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> you have just given me permission to leave france which i did </s>
<s> i have witnesses </s>
<s> and as you know i have no permission to re-enter france once out </s>
<s> now i learn i cannot enter germany </s>
<s> the students were laughing uproariously at this piece of logic and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile </s>
<s> but there is no question of a visa </s>
<s> the interior man looked uneasily at his french compatriot </s>
<s> the reporters were questioning the interior man and the french officer both of whom remained noncommittal as to what action if any would be taken in my regard </s>
<s> finally they went off to file their stories after the photographers had taken pictures of my latest vigil </s>
<s> the students crowded around asking questions slapping me on the back and generally being friendly </s>
<s> asked a young mustached frenchman </s>
<s> that would be a great help i told him thanking him for his thoughtfulness </s>
<s> the day passed eventfully enough with a constant stream of visitors some stopping only to say hello others getting into serious conversations such as one andre fuchs a free-lance journalist from strasbourg who wrote an article for the nouvelle alsatian in highly sympathetic terms </s>
<s> some students from the university returned around six with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week </s>
<s> a volunteer food brigade had been arranged they told me which would supply me with the necessities as long as i remained at the bridge </s>
<s> a little later the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent </s>
<s> one of the girl students sitting by while i ate the thick soup asked me if i had a sleeping bag </s>
<s> her name was esther peter </s>
<s> i was delighted to make that personal contact in such trying and unusual circumstances </s>
<s> the wind from the rhine was damp and chill necessitating a fire for warmth </s>
<s> after scouring around a bit in the open area i came across what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky </s>
<s> each evening the students appeared with the soup kettle and several petits pains esther usually being among them </s>
<s> sure enough mail began trickling in delivered by a talkative highly amused french postman who informed me there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that address would be recognized </s>
<s> on christmas eve students brought out two small christmas trees which i placed on either side of the tent </s>
<s> to my great surprise and delight when they saw the two trees they went rushing off returning shortly with decorations from their own trees </s>
<s> it was a merry if somewhat soggy christmas for me that year </s>
<s> in the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of cologne heidelberg and baden-baden </s>
<s> twenty thousand world citizens at stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town </s>
<s> when dr adenauer was approached by a world citizen delegation to find out his disposition of my case he gave them his personal approval of my entry saying that all men advocating peace should be welcomed into germany </s>
<s> the special guard however was still posted on kehl bridge </s>
<s> a voice drifted in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after i had fallen into a fitful sleep </s>
<s> i heard nothing more </s>
<s> she entreated me to see a doctor and when i refused brought one out to see me </s>
<s> he advised immediate hospitalization </s>
<s> esther mistaking my hesitation assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by a leading merchant in strasbourg whom she had already approached </s>
<s> at that moment up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a world citizen from basel switzerland </s>
<s> esther looked at me </s>
<s> i looked from her to him </s>
<s> i asked him </s>
<s> esther jumped up ran to him and gave him a little hug </s>
<s> now come garry we must go quickly </s>
<s> there is a police car outside </s>
<s> he remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of the final desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy </s>
<s> his hat was gone the tears were streaming from his eyes </s>
<s> he never knew how he got there </s>
<s> eight hundred and sixty-five rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day </s>
<s> eight field guns were captured in position </s>
<s> seven battle flags and fourteen officers swords were sent to thomas headquarters </s>
<s> it was the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks successfully made by either side during the atlanta campaign </s>
<s> the fourteenth regiment of ohio volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes among them being several men whose time of service had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment </s>
<s> a popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the civil war that thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up stanley for this assault </s>
<s> sherman was responsible for the story when he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall seeing thomas ride so fast </s>
<s> while thomas injured back led him to restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough when he had to </s>
<s> slocum made his reconnaissanace the next morning found the town empty accepted the surrender of the mayor and occupied the city a little before noon </s>
<s> the fourth corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of the line </s>
<s> before making the news public sherman sent an officer with the note to thomas </s>
<s> in a short time the officer returned and thomas followed on his heels </s>
<s> the cautious thomas re-examined the note and then making up his mind that it was genuine snapped his fingers whistled and almost danced in his exuberance </s>
<s> the next day sherman issued his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to atlanta </s>
<s> the measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter of personal choice </s>
<s> sherman laid great store by place captures </s>
<s> hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors </s>
<s> by both standards thomas had the right to be proud </s>
<s> thomas thanked his men for their tenacity of purpose unmurmuring endurance cheerful obedience brilliant heroism and high qualities in battle </s>
<s> sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the larger fruits of victory </s>
<s> he supposed the military world would approve of his accomplishment </s>
<s> whatever the military world thought the political world approved it wholeheartedly </s>
<s> lincoln was sure that he would not be re-elected </s>
<s> to the republicans no victory could have been more complete </s>
<s> official congratulations showered upon sherman and his army </s>
<s> lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability courage and perseverance </s>
<s> he felt that this campaign would be famous in the annals of war </s>
<s> grant called it prompt skillful and brilliant </s>
<s> halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war </s>
<s> actually the atlanta campaign was a military failure </s>
<s> next best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action </s>
<s> but so far as its territorial objectives were concerned the campaign was successful </s>
<s> within the narrow frame of military tactics too the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant </s>
<s> there was a battle on an average of once every three weeks </s>
<s> the skirmishing was almost constant </s>
<s> in the summary of the principal events of the campaign compiled from the official records there are only ten days which show no fighting </s>
<s> men were killed in their camps at their meals and in their sleep </s>
<s> rifle fire often kept the opposing gunners from manning their pieces </s>
<s> this system was dependent upon identical maps and thomas supplied them from a mobile lithograph press </s>
<s> orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement </s>
<s> sherman proved that a railway base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks </s>
<s> to the rebels it seemed as if sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets </s>
<s> as always the ranks worked out new and better tactics but there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their military thinking </s>
<s> sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old </s>
<s> he never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it </s>
<s> then in some way this lack of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice </s>
<s> a horse needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with two pounds </s>
<s> the horseman required eleven times more than the footman </s>
<s> so sherman tried a compromise </s>
<s> he would ship by rail five pounds per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could be picked up off the country </s>
<s> it failed to work </s>
<s> every recorded request by thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses </s>
<s> well led properly organized cavalry in its complementary role to infantry had four functions </s>
<s> first it could locate the enemy infantry learn what they were doing and hold them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over </s>
<s> second it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy </s>
<s> third it could threaten at all times and destroy when possible the enemy communications </s>
<s> it could reach key tactical points faster than infantry and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot soldier </s>
<s> its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated enemy but this chance never came in the atlanta campaign </s>
<s> thomas tried hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet but his plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum mobility and with its commander stripped from it </s>
<s> sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as thomas but he imagined a moving base with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings </s>
<s> his conception proved workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean deft well organized retreats with small materiel losses </s>
<s> when mcpherson pushed blindly through snake creek gap in a potentially decisive movement the only cavalry in his van was the ninth illinois mounted infantry totally inadequate for its role </s>
<s> a great part of the time thomas infantry never knew the location of the enemy line </s>
<s> at such times thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike him </s>
<s> it was the hard way to fight a war but thomas did it without making any disastrous mistakes </s>
<s> heat during the atlanta campaign coupled with unsuitable clothing caused individual irritation that was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean clothing </s>
<s> to relieve the itch and sweat galls the men got into the water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private truce while the men went swimming </s>
<s> johnston believed that sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various fords </s>
<s> lieutenant colonel james p brownlow who commanded the first brigade of thomas first cavalry division was ordered across one of these fords </s>
<s> they kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels drove the rebels out of their rifle pits and captured four men </s>
<s> most of the rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff brush than their naked pursuers </s>
<s> merited recommendations from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees from civil life </s>
<s> he never let me know that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning i was to leave for lymington </s>
<s> the result was that i found myself in the ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for the next week only two days before my departure from london </s>
<s> it need hardly be remarked that thompson was not generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant </s>
<s> when thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which included fervent verses from pantasaph mrs king felt a proper victorian alarm </s>
<s> katherine was staying at a convent and her mother felt that as thompson himself seems to have suggested she might eventually stay there </s>
<s> for his part thompson had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an honorable friendship between katie and himself </s>
<s> mr meynell knows the way </s>
<s> ever yours sincerely </s>
<s> a week in arrears and without means to pay i must go it is the only right thing </s>
<s> perhaps mrs meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book with all its mementos of her and the dear ones </s>
<s> the terrible blow of the new year put an end to that project </s>
<s> i wish you would return them to her </s>
<s> i have not the heart </s>
<s> i never had the courage to look at them when my projected volume became hopeless fearing they were poor until now when i was obliged to do so </s>
<s> and now </s>
<s> all chance of fulfilling my destiny is over </s>
<s> i want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems dear father-brother now i am gone </s>
<s> and launch them on the world when their time comes </s>
<s> for them a box will be lodgment enough </s>
<s> katie cannot mind your seeing them now </s>
<s> since my silence must have ended when i gave the purposed volume to you </s>
<s> if otherwise you will give me a pleasure </s>
<s> o wilfrid </s>
<s> it is strange </s>
<s> some of the poems express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love </s>
<s> the somewhat petrarchan love story which these poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more than a little of autobiographical sincerity </s>
<s> my own stern hand has rent the ancient bond and thereof shall the ending not have end but not for me that loved her to be fond lightly to please me with a newer friend then hold it more than bravest-feathered song that i affirm to thee with heart of pride i knew not what did to a friend belong till i stood up true friend by thy true side </s>
<s> there is every reason to recognize that in the very last years of his life as we shall see thompson did take the drug in carefully rationed doses to ease the pains of his illness but the exact date at which this began has never been determined </s>
<s> in any event the critical productivity of that time is abundant proof that if he was taking laudanum it was never in command of him to the extent that it had been during his vagrant years </s>
<s> he simply found more work for him to do and the articles and reviews continued without an evident break </s>
<s> as a reviewer thompson generally displayed a judicious attitude </s>
<s> that he read some of the books assigned to him with a studied carefulness is evident from his notes which are often so full that they provide an unquestionable basis for the identification of reviews that were printed without his signature </s>
<s> on the basis of this careful reading thompson frequently gave a clear complete and interesting description of a prose work or chose effective quotations to illustrate his discussions of poetry </s>
<s> he was seldom an unmethodical critic and his reviews generally followed a systematic pattern a description of what the work contained a treatment of the things that had especially interested him in it and wherever possible a balancing of whatever artistic merits and faults he might have found </s>
<s> it was of course in this drawing of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire to do full justice to an author </s>
<s> of course there were books about which nothing good could be said </s>
<s> as he had done on his first imperial sortie a year and a half before lewis trekked southeast through red russia to kamieniec </s>
<s> thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into podolia and nogay tartary or the yedisan </s>
<s> there along the east bank of the southern bug opposite the hamlet of zhitzhakli a few miles north of the black sea he arrived at general headquarters of the russian army </s>
<s> to consolidate what her navy had won the czarina was fortunate that for the first time in russian history her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command under her favorite giaour </s>
<s> potemkin was directing this conflict on three fronts in the caucasus </s>
<s> and in the misty marshlands and shallow coastal waters of nogay tartary and taurida including the crimean peninsula </s>
<s> here the war would flame to its focus and here lewis littlepage had come </s>
<s> during a sojourn of slightly more than three months chamberlain littlepage could see action on both elements </s>
<s> as his second in command the prince had marshal repnin one-time ambassador to poland </s>
<s> repnin who had a rather narrow face longish nose high forehead and arching brows looked like a quizzical mephistopheles </s>
<s> some people thought he lacked both ability and character but most agreed that he was noble in appearance and for a russian humane </s>
<s> the marshal came to know littlepage quite well </s>
<s> at general headquarters the newcomer in turn got to know others </s>
<s> then there were the distinguished foreign volunteers </s>
<s> representing the emperor were the prince de ligne still as impetuous as a youth of twenty </s>
<s> from milan came the young chevalier de litta an officer in the service of malta </s>
<s> though catherine was vexed at the number of french officers streaming to the turkish standard there were several under her own such as the prince de nassau </s>
<s> and the artillerist colonel prevost whom the count de segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills to nassau </s>
<s> from america were the messrs littlepage and jones </s>
<s> having done so he began to experience all the frustrations of others who attempted to get along with serenissimus and do a job at the same time </s>
<s> filigreed perfume boxes exuded the aromas of araby </s>
<s> around the billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen beribboned generals </s>
<s> at dinner the courses were carried in by tall cuirassiers in red capes and black fur caps topped with tufts of feathers marching in pairs like guards from a stage tragedy </s>
<s> among the visitors arriving every now and then there were of course women </s>
<s> for if serenissimus made the sign of the cross with his right hand and meant it with his left he beckoned lewdly to any lady who happened to catch his eye </s>
<s> right now he found sophie de witt that magnificent young matron he had spotted at kamieniec four years ago </s>
<s> the prince took her with him on every tour around the area and it was rumored he was utilizing her knowledge of constantinople as part of his espionage network </s>
<s> one evening he passed around the banquet table a crystal cup full of diamonds requesting every female guest to select one as a souvenir </s>
<s> when a lady chanced to soil a pair of evening slippers brigadier bauer was dispatched to paris for replacements </s>
<s> but if the prince fancied women and was fascinated by foreigners he could be haughtiness personified to his subordinates </s>
<s> he had collared one of his generals in public </s>
<s> his coat trimmed in sable diamond stars of the orders of saints andrew or george agleam he was often prone to sit sulkily eye downcast in a scheherazade trance </s>
<s> when this happened everything stopped </s>
<s> he stays inactive for half the summer in front of oczakov a quite second-rate spot begins to besiege it formally only during the autumn rains and finally carries it by assault in the heart of winter </s>
<s> to help him do so the prince had conferred control of his land forces on a soldier who was different from him in almost every respect save one both were eccentrics of the purest ray serene </s>
<s> he had a small mouth with deep furrows on either side a large flat nose and penetrating blue eyes </s>
<s> his gray hair was thin his face beginning to attract a swarm of wrinkles </s>
<s> he was ugly </s>
<s> like all russians he was an emotional man and in him the emotions warred </s>
<s> but he was perpetually engaged in a battle to command his own temper </s>
<s> woe betide the interviewee if he answered vaguely </s>
<s> better to give an asinine answer than none at all </s>
<s> despising luxuries of any sort for a soldier he slept on a pile of hay with his cloak as blanket </s>
<s> his breakfast was tea </s>
<s> his dinner fell anywhere from nine to noon </s>
<s> his supper was nothing </s>
<s> he kept several pet birds and liked cats well enough that if one crept by he would mew at it in friendly fashion </s>
<s> passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark </s>
<s> he had come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity allowed mere field officers a certain leeway at court </s>
<s> in camp he knew it won you the affection of your men </s>
<s> he had accordingly cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature </s>
<s> underneath he remained one of the best-educated russians of his day </s>
<s> he dabbled in verse could get along well among most of the european languages and was fluent in french and german </s>
<s> he had also mastered the cossack tongue </s>
<s> for those little men with the short whiskers shaven polls and top knots suvorov reserved a special esteem </s>
<s> suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding skirmishers not demographic units but military men of a high potential </s>
<s> he always kept a few on his personal staff </s>
<s> he often donned their tribal costumes such as the one featuring a tall black sheepskin hat from the top of which dangled a little red bag ornamented by a chain of worsted lace and tassels </s>
<s> broad red stripes down the trouser leg </s>
<s> broader leather belt round the waist holding cartridges and light sabre </s>
<s> suvorov played parent not just to his cossacks but to all his troops </s>
<s> it was probably at this period that littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary russian soldier </s>
<s> when their levies came shambling into camp they were all elbows hair and beard </s>
<s> mando pleading her cause must have said that dr brown was the most distinguished physician in the united states of america for our man poured out his symptoms and drew a madly waving line indicating the irregularity of his pulse </s>
<s> he looked disapprovingly at an ash tray piled high with cigarette stubs shook his head and moved his hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture </s>
<s> the little official hung his head in shame </s>
<s> seeing this his colleague at the next desk gave a short contemptuous laugh pushed forward his own ash tray innocent of a single butt thumped his chest to show his excellent condition and looked proud </s>
<s> the doctor gravely nodded approval </s>
<s> at this moment mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem was solved and all norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers </s>
<s> we went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents and more officials awaited us the rest of the office personnel hot upon our heels </s>
<s> by this time word had got around that an american doctor was on the premises </s>
<s> one fellow who had liver spots held out his hands to the great healer </s>
<s> it was funny but it was also touching </s>
<s> after luncheon we took advantage of the siesta period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our dear friend deppy had written </s>
<s> deppy is despina messinesi a long-time member of the vogue staff who although born in boston was born there of greek parents </s>
<s> several years of her life have been spent in the homeland and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming </s>
<s> the wear and tear of life have taught me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers but i planned on being the soul of tact of giving them plenty of outs was there the tiniest implication that their cups were already running over without us </s>
<s> my diplomacy was needless </s>
<s> greek phone service is worse than french so that it was to be some little time before contact of any sort was established </s>
<s> in the late afternoon mando came back to fetch us and we drove to the acropolis </s>
<s> we stopped first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned by the parthenon </s>
<s> the curving benches are broken chipped tumbled but still in place as are the marble chairs the seats of honor for the legislators </s>
<s> the carved statues of the frieze against the low wall are for the most part headless but their exquisitely graceful nude and draped torsos and the kneeling atlantes are well preserved in their perfect proportion </s>
<s> having completed our camera work we started our climb </s>
<s> i suppose the same emotion holds if to a lesser degree with any famous monument </s>
<s> the weight of fame and history is formidable and dreary steel engravings in schoolbooks do little to quicken interest and imagination </s>
<s> and then perhaps one day we get to athens </s>
<s> we are here </s>
<s> it had better be good </s>
<s> it is awe-inspiring </s>
<s> probably every visitor has a favorite time for his first sight of it </s>
<s> we saw it frequently afterward but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset </s>
<s> the light at that time is a benediction </s>
<s> the serene majestic columns of the parthenon tawny in color against the pure deep blue sky frame incredible vistas </s>
<s> all we wanted to do was to stand very quietly and look and look and look </s>
<s> it was hit by a shell fired by the bombarding venetian army and the great central portion of the temple was blown to smithereens </s>
<s> nearby is the temple of athena </s>
<s> the architectural feature the caryatides upholding the portico famous around the world as the porch of the maidens was referred to airily by mando as the girls place </s>
<s> another beautiful building is the propylaea the entrance gate of the acropolis </s>
<s> for some happy reason doric ionic and corinthian have always stuck in my mind </s>
<s> furthermore i can identify each design </s>
<s> it remained however for mando to teach me that doric symbolized strength ionic wisdom and corinthian beauty the three pillars of the ancient world </s>
<s> the columns of the parthenon are fluted doric </s>
<s> another classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the evzone sentry in his ballet skirt with great pompons on his shoes who was patrolling up and down in front of the palace </s>
<s> gun on shoulder he would march smartly for a few yards bring his heels together with a click make a brisk pirouette skirts flaring and march back to his point of departure </s>
<s> we did not dare speak to so exalted a being but norton aimed his camera and shot him so to speak on the rise the split second between the halt and the turn </s>
<s> the evening of our first day we drove with christopher and judy sakellariadis who were friends and patients of norton to dine at a restaurant on the shores of the aegean </s>
<s> on the way out mr sakellariadis detoured up a special hill from which one may obtain a matchless view of the acropolis lighted by night </s>
<s> the great spectacle was a source of rancor and son et lumiere which the french were trying to promote with the athenians was the reason </s>
<s> these performances were being staged at historical monuments throughout europe </s>
<s> by a combination of music lighting effects and narration famous events that have transpired in these locations are evoked and re-created for large audiences usually to considerable acclaim </s>
<s> the acropolis had been scheduled for the treatment too but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full moon when the athenians themselves out of respect for the natural beauty of the occasion were wont to forgo their own usual nocturnal illumination </s>
<s> athenian society was split into two factions the philistines and the artists </s>
<s> the artists contended that the philistines gross of soul were all for having son et lumiere since the french were footing the bill and the attraction wherever it had been done had proven popular </s>
<s> this was the crassest kind of materialism and they the artists would have no truck with it </s>
<s> it was very stimulating </s>
<s> the restaurant to which the sakellariadises took us on this night of controversy was the asteria on asteria beach </s>
<s> this is a public bathing beach easily accessible by tramway from the center of athens </s>
<s> office workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during the siesta period which during the summer lasts from two until five in the afternoon when shops and offices are again open for business </s>
<s> they close sometime after eight </s>
<s> bedtime is late for the balmy evenings are delightful and everyone wants to linger under the stars </s>
<s> the sand is fine and pleasant the cabanas are clean and the parasols green raspberry and butter yellow are very gay </s>
<s> although open to the general public it is not overcrowded </s>
<s> the atmosphere is that of an attractive private beach club at home </s>
<s> we went there a couple of times to swim and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly </s>
<s> this agreeable state of affairs is explicable i think on two counts </s>
<s> one is greece is not yet suffering from overpopulation </s>
<s> the public may still find pleasure in public places </s>
<s> the other is that the charge for cabanas and parasols though modest from an american point of view still is a little high for many athenians </s>

<s> for a delightful drive out of athens i should recommend sounion at the end of the attic peninsula </s>
<s> the road a comparatively new one is very good winding along inlets coves and bays of deep and brilliant blue </s>
<s> i suppose the day will inevitably come when the area will be encrusted with developments but at present it is deserted and seductive </s>
<s> three beneficial hurdles to progress are the lack of water electricity and telephones </s>
<s> at sounion there is a group of beautiful columns the ruins of a temple to poseidon of particular interest at that time as active reconstruction was in progress </s>
<s> gaunt scaffoldings adjoined the ruins and on the ground segments of columns two and a half to three feet in thickness were being fitted with sections cunningly chiseled to match exactly the fluting and proportion of the original </s>
<s> later they would be hoisted into place </s>
<s> i think its thirst had never been assuaged before </s>
<s> to enter it you go down five or six steps from the road </s>
<s> across the road is the kitchen and waiters bearing great trays of dishes dodge traffic as nimbly as their french colleagues at the restaurant in the place du tertre in paris </s>

<s> greece was one of the highlights of our trip but beginning in greece and continuing around the world throughout southeast asia the treatment of animals was horrifying ranging from callous indifference to active cruelty </s>
<s> this of course was not true of the educated and sophisticated people we met who loved their pets but kindness is not a basic human instinct </s>
<s> we met some charming athenians and among them our chauffeur panyotis ranked high </s>
<s> his english was limited and the little he knew he found irritating </s>
<s> this he claimed was the favorite refrain of the english </s>
<s> they would be lolling under a tree sipping ouzo relishing the leisurely life assuring him that the day was yet young </s>
<s> to exonerate the legislature and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation pike took another course and made it appear that the legislature had been bilked </s>
<s> he claimed in his attacks that woodruff with scurrilous underhandedness had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract without knowing what they were doing </s>
<s> the game is not worth the ammunition it would cost </s>
<s> so persistent were these attacks that in march of the following year woodruff was finally moved to action and pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics the subtle art of diversion </s>
<s> to attack pike directly would gain woodruff little for as a penniless newcomer pike had nothing to lose </s>
<s> by this time woodruff had accurately measured pike as a man of great personal pride a man who would fly into a towering rage if his integrity were questioned and who would be anxious to avenge himself </s>
<s> the charges would be made in the gazette by an anonymous correspondent and pike would be so busy trying to track down the illusive character assassin that he would forget about harassing woodruff </s>
<s> the strategy worked perfectly </s>
<s> the anonymous correspondent did not resort to innuendoes </s>
<s> he called pike a thief </s>
<s> he said pike had stolen mules from harris during the santa fe expedition </s>
<s> he accused pike of continuing his sticky-fingered career in arkansas with the theft of some otter skins in van buren </s>
<s> the charges caught pike off balance coming as they did from an unexpected quarter </s>
<s> finally he learned through the grapevine that the culprit might be one james w robinson in pope county </s>
<s> without further inquiry pike jumped to the conclusion that robinson was guilty and following the honorable route that would eventually lead to the dueling ground sent a message to robinson through his friends demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity </s>
<s> robinson did neither </s>
<s> to pike silence was tantamount to an admission of guilt and he determined to get robinson onto the dueling ground at all costs </s>
<s> if robinson was a liar and a slanderer he was also a very canny gentleman for nothing that pike could do would pry so much as a single word out of him </s>
<s> preoccupied with his own defense and his attempts to get robinson to fight pike lessened his attacks on woodruff and finally stopped them altogether </s>
<s> it took pike a long time to realize what woodruff had done and it had a profound effect on him </s>
<s> once he learned a lesson he never forgot it </s>
<s> in the next few months of comparative silence pike waited patiently until conditions were perfect for a new attack and then displaying a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting gained from his first bout with woodruff he used these changed conditions to excellent advantage </s>
<s> one-armed gruff frugally honest governor pope had been the ideal man to assume office in arkansas after the disgraceful antics of political bosses like crittenden and he ruled the state with an iron fist tolerating no nonsense </s>
<s> woodruff had supported him all the way both as a chief executive and as a man </s>
<s> besides being political allies they were also friends </s>
<s> woodruff wanted this political windfall very badly and everyone assumed that he would get it because he was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest supporter </s>
<s> after all woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was the logical man for the job </s>
<s> woodruff was furious </s>
<s> it is but justice to mr steele for us to add that in the above remarks nothing is intended to his disparagement either as a lawyer or as a printer </s>
<s> he got a good fat job and we congratulate him on his good luck </s>
<s> it was at this point that pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two men </s>
<s> the eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract that woodruff still held </s>
<s> from his first bout with the canny woodruff pike had learned that it was better not to attack him directly so harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too high he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs to exist </s>
<s> to document his charge pike set up two parallel columns in the advocate showing the price charged by the gazette and the considerably lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere </s>
<s> then he called on the governor to explain why </s>
<s> the governor was not used to having his integrity questioned and he promptly passed the charges on to woodruff demanding that woodruff answer them </s>
<s> if woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation the governor insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the scale printed in the advocate </s>
<s> woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma </s>
<s> as a consequence he did neither </s>
<s> and for the moment at least the governor now found himself allied with the head of the crittenden faction he had formerly opposed and pike was credited with a clear triumph over woodruff </s>
<s> but in the confused atmosphere of frontier politics alliances were as quickly broken as they were formed and as pike came to favor with the governor of the territory the governor fell out of favor with the president of the united states </s>
<s> fulton was a very close friend of jackson and had been his private secretary for a number of years in the old days </s>
<s> as a stanch party man and a rabid democrat he had little tolerance for whigs like pike and pike lost any immediate personal advantage his victory over woodruff might have gained him </s>

<s> as pike proved himself adept in the political arena he also became a social lion in the village of little rock where he served as a symbol of the culture that the ladies of the town were striving so eagerly to cultivate </s>
<s> after all pike was an established poet and his work had been published in the respectable periodicals of that center of american culture boston </s>
<s> his accomplishments and the fact that he was resident did much to offset the unkind words travelers used to describe little rock after a visit there </s>
<s> for some reason none of them were impressed with the territorial capital </s>
<s> the internationally known sportsman and traveler friedrich gerstacker was typical of its detractors in the mid-thirties </s>
<s> pike enjoyed his new social position tremendously and cultivated in himself those traits necessary to its preservation </s>
<s> he was especially popular with women for like the romantic poetry he wrote he was personally gracious gallant and chivalrous </s>
<s> he again began to play the violin and tucking the instrument beneath his chin performed soulful and romantic airs to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered to hear him </s>
<s> his artistic accomplishments guaranteed him entry into any social gathering </s>
<s> he composed songs and set them to music and sang them in a soft melodious voice and when his audience had had enough of music he would discourse on politics or tell stories of his western adventures guaranteed to excite the emotions of men and women alike </s>
<s> the bulk of his early reputation however came not from his poetry or his music but from his excellence as an orator </s>
<s> the orator of this period in order to earn a reputation had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his speech judging how it would appear in print as well as the effect it would have on the audience that heard it </s>
<s> very soon after his arrival in little rock pike had joined one of the most influential organizations in town the little rock debating society and it was with this group that he made his debut as an orator being invited to deliver the annual fourth of july address the club sponsored every year </s>
<s> his contemporaries in massachusetts called him an arch-heretic a beast a miscreant a proud and pestilent seducer a prodigious minter of exorbitant novelties </s>
<s> he was thrown out more or less from boston plymouth pocasset newport and providence </s>
<s> he said gorton was a holy man </s>
<s> wept day and night for the sins and blindness of the world had a long walk through the trees and woods by his house where he constantly walked morning and evening and even in the depths of the night alone by himself for contemplation and the enjoyment of the dispensation of light </s>
<s> there is plenty more to recommend gorton the facts of whose life are given in the life and times of samuel gorton by adelos gorton </s>
<s> he fought like a fiend for the helpless and oppressed worked for the abolition of slavery helped the quakers and indians and worked against the prosecution of witches </s>
<s> he defied the boston hierarchy and after they sent a small army to get him he befuddled the court including john cotton with one of the most complicated religious discourses ever heard </s>
<s> although he did not attend any celebrated schools or universities he was a master of greek and hebrew and could read the bible in the original </s>
<s> roger williams had recently been thrown out and anne hutchinson and her antinomians were slugging it out with the powers-that-be </s>
<s> gorton and his family moved to plymouth </s>
<s> soon he was in trouble there for defending a woman who was accused of smiling in church </s>
<s> gorton said they were preparing to deport her as a vagabond and to escape the shame she fled to the woods for several days returning at night </s>
<s> he advised the poor woman not to appear in court as what she was charged with was not in violation of law </s>
<s> gorton appeared for her however and what he told the magistrates must have been plenty for he was charged with deluding the court fined and told to leave the colony within fourteen days </s>
<s> his wife was in delicate health and nursing an infant with measles </s>
<s> the unconquerable mrs hutchinson was residing at pocasset after having been excommunicated by the boston church and thrown out of the colony </s>
<s> one can imagine that with her and gorton there it was no place for anyone with weak nerves </s>
<s> then he became involved in a ruckus remarkably similar to the one in plymouth </s>
<s> while driving the cow back home the woman was assaulted by a servant maid of gorton </s>
<s> the old woman complained to the deputy governor who ordered the servant brought before the court </s>
<s> gorton reverted to his plymouth tactics refused to let her go and appeared himself before the portsmouth grand jury </s>
<s> he was jailed and banished </s>
<s> gorton then moved to providence and soon put the town in a turmoil </s>
<s> he held that no group of colonists could set up or maintain a government without royal sanction </s>
<s> since rhode island at that time did not have such sanction his opinion was not popular </s>
<s> some few and myself withstand his inhabitation and town privileges without confession and reformation of his uncivil and inhuman practices at portsmouth </s>
<s> providence finally managed to get gorton out of the town and he and some friends bought land at pawtuxet on the west side of narragansett bay five miles south but still within the jurisdiction of the providence colony </s>
<s> this town should not be confused with pawtucket just north of providence or pawcatuck connecticut on the pawcatuck river opposite westerly rhode island </s>
<s> up to now gorton had been looking for trouble and now that he was trying to get away from it trouble started looking for him </s>
<s> upon intelligence that the formidable agitator was to favor them with his presence the benighted inhabitants of pawtuxet alas gave their allegiance to massachusetts and asked that colony to expel the newcomers </s>
<s> gorton and company however promptly bought land from miantonomi a few miles south of pawtuxet extending from the present gaspee point south to warwick neck and twenty miles inland </s>
<s> the settlement was called shawomet </s>
<s> it was not within the jurisdiction of anybody or anything including providence and massachusetts </s>
<s> if gorton wanted peace and quiet for his complicated meditations this is where he should have had it </s>
<s> instead of that he was engulfed by bedlam </s>
<s> following the glorious lead of the heroes of pawtuxet they also submitted themselves to the protection of massachusetts </s>
<s> one historical authority presents laborious and circuitous testimony tending to arouse suspicion that massachusetts was behind the clouds settling down on the embattled gorton </s>
<s> however the general court at boston ordered the purchasers of shawomet to appear before them to answer the sachems claim </s>
<s> the purchasers rejected the order in two letters written in vigorous terms </s>
<s> then massachusetts switched to its standard tactics </s>
<s> it pointed out twenty-six instances of blasphemy in the letters and ordered the writers to submit or force of arms would be used </s>
<s> the next week forty soldiers were sent to get the miscreants </s>
<s> the latter tried to arbitrate through a delegation from providence which offer was declined by the invaders </s>
<s> at shawomet women and children fled in terror across the bay </s>
<s> the men fortified a blockhouse and got ready to fight but meanwhile appealed to the king and again tried to arbitrate </s>
<s> gorton evidently still had plenty to learn about massachusetts but he was learning fast </s>
<s> the attackers sent for more soldiers and the defenders to save bloodshed surrendered under the promise that they would be treated as neighbors </s>
<s> promptly their livestock was taken and according to gorton the soldiers were ordered to knock down anyone who should utter a word of insolence and run through anyone who might step out of line </s>
<s> gorton and ten of his friends were thrown in jail </s>
<s> on sunday they refused to attend church </s>
<s> the magistrates were determined to compel them </s>
<s> the prisoners agreed provided they might speak after the sermon which was permitted </s>
<s> the boston elders were great at befuddling the opposition with torrents of ecclesiastical obscurities but gorton was better </s>
<s> reverend cotton preached to them about demetrius and the shrines of ephesus </s>
<s> gorton replied with blasts that scandalized the congregation </s>
<s> at the trial which took place later the pomham matter was completely omitted </s>
<s> the gortonists were charged with blasphemy and tried for their lives </s>
<s> gorton answered in writing </s>
<s> all of the elders except three voted for death but a majority of the deputies refused to sanction the sentence </s>

<s> when fred wheeled him back into his room the big one looking out on the back porch and put him to bed papa told him he was very tired but that he had enjoyed greatly the trip downtown </s>

<s> papa was still elated over his afternoon visit downtown </s>
<s> the next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent spirits </s>
<s> it began in the morning and very quickly the hemorrhage was a massive one </s>
<s> the hemorrhage was in the prostate region </s>
<s> dr glenn saw at once what had happened </s>
<s> to give a patient the wrong type of blood said the doctor would likely kill him </s>
<s> that was in the days before blood banks of course and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to patient </s>
<s> and then it took considerably longer to make preparations for giving transfusions </s>
<s> they had to take blood samples to the laboratory to test them for one thing and there was much required preliminary procedure </s>
<s> they made the tests and came to fred </s>
<s> by now it was perhaps two days or longer after papa had begun hemorrhaging </s>
<s> fred demanded </s>

<s> the burial was out in riverside cemetery </s>
<s> all about him stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands had fashioned </s>
<s> at his death fred and ralph my husband were named executors of the estate under the terms of the will </s>
<s> fred and ralph qualified as executors and paid off what debts were currently due and they were all current since papa was never one to allow bills to go unpaid </s>
<s> after they had paid all his debts and the funeral costs ralph and fred had some fourteen thousand dollars as i remember with which to pay the bequests </s>
<s> tom had received four years of education at the university of north carolina and two at harvard and fred had been in and out of georgia tech and carneigie tech and part of the time had been a self-help student </s>
<s> so because he had received less than tom it was felt proper that fred should receive the few hundred dollars that remained </s>
<s> papa i should emphasize had been an invalid the last several years of his life </s>
<s> his hospital and doctor bills had been large and his income had been cut until he was receiving little except small rentals on some properties he still owned </s>
<s> but he had succeeded well we agreed </s>
<s> he had left us a legacy far more valuable than houses and lands and stocks and bonds </s>
<s> for years papa and mama had been large taxpayers </s>
<s> in those years of lower property valuations and lower tax rates that payment represented ownership of much property </s>
<s> but he never expected to do that </s>
<s> in the spring of his second year at harvard tom had been offered a job at northwestern university as an instructor in the english department </s>
<s> but he had delayed accepting this job and as he was leaving to come home to papa in response to our telegram he dropped a postcard to miss mccrady head of the harvard appointment office asking her please to write northwestern authorities and explain the circumstances </s>
<s> he wanted to go back to harvard for another year of playwriting </s>
<s> but he was happy to tell her that his finances were now in such condition that he could go back to harvard for a third year with professor baker </s>
<s> that third year he wrote plays with a fury </s>
<s> i believe there are seventeen short plays by tom now housed in the houghton library at harvard </s>
<s> that fall he submitted to professor baker the first acts and outlines of the following acts of several plays six of them according to some of his associates and he also worked on a play that he first called niggertown the material for which he had collected during the summer at home </s>
<s> later this play would be called welcome to our city </s>
<s> in the spring it must have been he began working on the play that he called the house which later would be mannerhouse </s>
<s> it ran two nights and though it was generally praised there was considerable criticism of its length </s>
<s> it was demonstrated many critics would later point out in the length of his novels </s>
<s> in this play there were so many characters and so much detail </s>
<s> tom never knew how to condense to boil down </s>
<s> he was always concerned with life and he tried to picture it whole </s>
<s> he wanted nothing compressed tight </s>
<s> he was a big man and he wanted nothing little squeezed </s>
<s> he despised parsimony and particularly of words </s>
<s> that summer tom attended the summer session at harvard but he did not ask mama to send him back in the fall </s>
<s> instead he went down to new york and submitted welcome to our city to the theatre guild which had asked him to let them have a look at it after professor baker had recommended it highly </s>
<s> he hung around new york waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production and in that time came down to asheville and also paid a short visit to chapel hill where with almost childish delight he visited old friends and favorite campus spots </s>
<s> on returning to new york he had a job for several weeks </s>
<s> it was visiting university of north carolina alumni in new york to ask them for contributions to the graham memorial building fund </s>
<s> the graham memorial would be the campus student union honoring the late and much beloved edward kidder graham who had been president when tom entered the university </s>
<s> well the theatre guild kept that play and kept it and finally in december they turned it down </s>
<s> but they would reconsider it they assured him if he would rewrite it </s>
<s> tom told me about it how one evening he went over to see the theatre guild man </s>
<s> tom said he almost burst into tears he was so disappointed and put out </s>
<s> it was fantastic writing beautiful writing the man declared but the public he insisted wanted realism </s>

<s> there are millions who accept this doctrine but few indeed are those who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on their souls night and day </s>
<s> this group in park place church was made up of the earnest few </s>
<s> i was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns and responsibilities </s>
<s> i engaged more and more in religious activities </s>
<s> besides church and sunday school i went to out-of-door meetings on the sidewalk at the church door </s>
<s> i went to an afternoon service at the aj </s>
<s> i went to the christian endeavor society and to the evening service of the church </s>
<s> much of this lacked the active support of the pastor </s>
<s> the young people were self-energizing and i was energized </s>
<s> meanwhile i myself was not yet saved </s>
<s> at least i had been unable to lay hold on the experience of conversion </s>
<s> try as i might to confess my sins and accept salvation no answer came to me from heaven </s>
<s> finally after years i gave up </s>
<s> the basic difficulty i suppose was in my ultimate inability to feel a burden of sin from which i sought relief </s>
<s> no load of sin had been laid on my shoulders nor did earnest effort enable me to become conscious of one </s>
<s> there is of course the doctrine of original sin which asserts that each of us as individuals partakes of the guilt of our first ancestor </s>
<s> this doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense </s>
<s> i did not feel it presumptuous to expect that the creator would be at least as just as the most righteous of his creatures </s>
<s> and the doctrine of original sin is compounded of injustice </s>
<s> the actual impelling force which severed me from evangelical effort was of another sort </s>
<s> i became disgusted at being so preoccupied with the state of my own miserable soul </s>
<s> they have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years which since have passed </s>
<s> i do not claim to be free from sin or from the need for repentance and forgiveness </s>
<s> in my experience the assurance of forgiveness comes only when i have confessed to the wronged one and have made as full reparation as i can devise </s>
<s> there was one further step in my religious progress </s>
<s> this was taken after i came to live in springfield and it was made under the guidance of the reverend raymond beardslee a young preacher who came to the congregational church there at about the same time that i moved from new york </s>
<s> his father was a professor at hartford theological seminary and from him he acquired a conviction which he passed along to me that there is in the universe of persons a moral law the law of love which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law </s>
<s> it is most important that we recognize the law of love as being unbreakable in all personal relationships whether individually socially or as between whole nations of people </s>
<s> if obeyed the law brings order and satisfaction </s>
<s> if disobeyed the result is turmoil and chaos </s>
<s> as we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable </s>
<s> we can conceive of no alternatives </s>
<s> their basis seems deeper than mere authority </s>
<s> they are not true because scientists or prophets say they are true </s>
<s> it is not the authority of god himself which makes them true </s>
<s> because god is what he is the laws of the universe material and spiritual are what they are </s>
<s> deity and law are one and inseparable </s>
<s> with this conviction the partition between the sacred and the secular disappears </s>
<s> in his book civilization and ethics albert schweitzer faces the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business life for example </s>
<s> one serves society by conducting a business from which a certain number of employees draw their means of subsistence </s>
<s> another by giving away his property in order to help his fellow man </s>
<s> each will decide on his own course somewhere between these two extreme cases according to the sense of responsibility which is determined for him by the particular circumstances of his own life </s>
<s> he is uncompromising in assigning guilt to the man who finds it necessary to inflict or permit injury to one individual or group for the sake of a larger good </s>
<s> for this decision a man must take personal responsibility </s>
<s> or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive </s>
<s> schweitzer seems in fact to acquire for himself a burden of sin not bequeathed by adam but accumulated in the inevitable judgments which life requires of him as between greater and lesser responsibilities </s>
<s> this viewpoint i find interesting but it has never weighed on my soul </s>
<s> perhaps it should have </s>
<s> my own experience has followed simpler lines </s>
<s> an uncompromising belief in the moral law has the advantage of making religion natural even as physical law is natural </s>
<s> neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels any self-consciousness in obeying the laws of matter and energy nor can he achieve a sense of self-righteousness in such obedience </s>
<s> to obey the moral law is just ordinary common sense applied to a neglected field </s>
<s> religion thus becomes integrated with life </s>
<s> this truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries </s>
<s> one of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life </s>
<s> these lives are in themselves outside of the moral order and are unburdened with moral responsibility </s>
<s> one cannot read the records of scientists officials and travelers who have penetrated to the minds of the most savage races without realizing that each individual met with is a person </s>
<s> the australian aborigine is the conventional exemplar of degraded humanity </s>
<s> yet here was a depth of sensibility which is lacking in a considerable portion of the beneficiaries of our civilization </s>
<s> persons whether white black brown or yellow are a concern of god </s>
<s> respect for personality is a privilege and a duty for us as brothers </s>
<s> such is the field for exercising our reverence </s>
<s> with the knowledge that the kingdom comes by obedience to the moral law in our relations with all people we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means and the ends of our lives </s>
<s> this intellectual approach to spiritual life suited me well because i was never content to lead a divided life </s>
<s> let us now give some thought to the soul </s>
<s> when the young biologist dr ballard began to show interest in our daughter elizabeth this induced a corresponding interest on our part in him </s>
<s> i asked one day what he was doing </s>
<s> he told me that he had a big newt and a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye of the big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto the big newt </s>
<s> he was then noting that the big eye on the little newt hung back until the little eye had grown up to it while the little eye on the big newt grew rapidly until it was as big as the other </s>
<s> this was a profound statement </s>
<s> in the face of the unfolding universe our ultimate attitude is that of wonder </s>
<s> wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world </s>
<s> gone are the days when in the nineteenth century scientists thought that they were close to the attainment of complete knowledge of the physical universe </s>
<s> for them only a little more needed to be learned and then all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted packaged and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human problem </s>
<s> this complacency was blown to bits by the relativity of einstein the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the discovery of the expanding universe </s>
<s> none of these discoveries were neatly rounded off bits of knowledge </s>
<s> each faded out into the unexplored areas of the future </s>
<s> it is as if we in our center of human observation from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown </s>
<s> as our radius of penetration r increases the area of new knowledge increases by af and the total of human knowledge becomes measured in terms of af </s>
<s> wonder grows </s>
<s> it is endless </s>
<s> there are some people intelligent people who seem to be untouched by the sea of wonder in which we are immersed and in which we spend our lives </s>
<s> one such is abraham meyer the writer of a recent book speaking of man </s>
<s> this is a straightforward denial of the spiritual world and a vigorous defense of pure materialism </s>
<s> his inability to wonder vitiates his argument </s>
<s> criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for our study of three moderns if we see how certain critics in the past have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature </s>
<s> i have chosen five contrasting pairs ten men in all and they are arranged in roughly chronological order </s>
<s> such a list must naturally be selective and the treatment of each man is brief for i am interested only in their general ideas on the moral measure of literature </s>
<s> altogether the list will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider art above ethics all the way from plato to poe </s>
<s> and most of the great periods are represented because we will compare plato and aristotle from the golden age of greece </s>
<s> stephen gosson and sir philip sidney from renaissance england </s>
<s> dr johnson and william hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in england </s>
<s> and james russell lowell and edgar allan poe of nineteenth century american letters </s>
<s> plato and aristotle </s>
<s> plato and aristotle agree on some vital literary issues </s>
<s> they both measure literature by moral standards and in their political writings both allow for censorship but the differences between them are also significant </s>
<s> while aristotle censors literature only for the young plato would banish all poets from his ideal state </s>
<s> even more important in his poetics aristotle differs somewhat from plato when he moves in the direction of treating literature as a unique thing separate and apart from its causes and its effects </s>
<s> all through the republic plato attends to the way art relates to the general life and ultimately to a good life for his citizens </s>
<s> in short he is constantly concerned with the ethical effects </s>
<s> when he discusses the subject matter of poetry he asks what moral effect the scenes will have </s>
<s> when he turns briefly to literary style in the third book he again looks to the effect on the audience </s>
<s> plato is at times just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he is of their work </s>
<s> when he discusses tyrants in the eighth book of the republic he pictures the poets as willing to praise the worst rulers </s>
<s> but the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears in the tenth book and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms </s>
<s> true reality of course is the ideal and the poet knows nothing of this </s>
<s> only the philosopher knows the truth </s>
<s> poets moreover dwell on human passions </s>
<s> the same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both babbitt and more that we must examine it in some detail </s>
<s> plato feels that man has two competing aspects his rational faculty and his irrational </s>
<s> we can be virtuous only if we control our lower natures the passions in this case and strengthen our rational side </s>
<s> and poetry with all its emphasis on the passions encourages the audience to give way to emotion </s>
<s> for this reason then poetry tends to weaken the power of control the reason because it tempts one to indulge his passions and even the best of men he maintains may be corrupted by this subtle influence </s>
<s> his whole objection indeed seems to rise out of a deep conviction that the poets do have great power to influence but plato seldom pays any attention to what might be called the poem itself </s>
<s> he is rather concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets to join his fight for justice </s>
<s> while plato finally allows a few acceptable hymns to the gods and famous men still he clearly leaves the way open for further discussion of the issue </s>
<s> he even calls upon the poets to defend the muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue </s>
<s> in the ideal state for instance he argues that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully selected tales and stories </s>
<s> for this reason he would banish indecent pictures and speeches from the stage </s>
<s> and the young people should not even be permitted to see comedies till they are old enough to drink strong wine and sit at the public tables </s>
<s> by the time they reach that age however aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence of comedies </s>
<s> once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms he lays down his famous definition of tragedy which sets up standards and so lends direction to the remainder of the work </s>
<s> a tragedy by his definition is an imitation of an action that is serious of a certain magnitude and complete in itself </s>
<s> it should have a dramatic form with pleasing language and it should portray incidents which so arouse pity and fear that it purges these emotions in the audience </s>
<s> throughout the rest of the poetics aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics of these six parts and their interrelationship and he refers frequently to the standards suggested by his definition of tragedy </s>
<s> the chicago contingent of modern critics follow aristotle so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation </s>
<s> for one thing aristotle mentions that plays may corrupt the audience </s>
<s> in addition his definition of a tragedy invites our attention because a serious and important action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author or of the characters </s>
<s> he rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to that end </s>
<s> the point is that an ethical critic with an assist from freud can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with a harmless outlet for our hostile urges </s>
<s> if krutch is correct tragedy may have quite the opposite effect </s>
<s> it may allay our passions and so restore the rule of reason </s>
<s> or in more freudian terms the experience may serve to sublimate our destructive urges and strengthen the ego and superego </s>
<s> gosson and sidney </s>
<s> the second half of the sixteenth century in england was the setting for a violent and long controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature especially the drama </s>
<s> no one suggested that the ethical effects of the art were irrelevant </s>
<s> both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral test but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or a bad influence </s>
<s> both sides claimed that plato and aristotle supported their cause </s>
<s> many students of literature know that classical defense </s>
<s> what is not so well known however and what is quite important for understanding the issues of this early quarrel is the kind of attack on literature that sidney was answering </s>
<s> with that act of parliament the opponents of the stage won the day and for more than two decades after that england had no legitimate public drama </s>
<s> in the early days of this controversy over the theater one of the interested parties stephen gosson published a little tract in which he objected mildly to the abuses of art rather than the art itself </s>
<s> he does not really approve of levity and laughter but sex is the deadly sin </s>
<s> but it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions at the point just reached </s>
<s> fortunately it is possible to be somewhat more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in education </s>
<s> for this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and psychological studies of students in american colleges and universities and particularly from the cornell values studies </s>
<s> hence changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals at two points in time </s>
<s> we find in the first place that the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing do not accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the public prints and on the whole approve of the way their university deals with value-problems and value inculcation </s>
<s> it is not our impression that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful ignorance </s>
<s> rather the generality of these students find their university experience congenial to their own sense of values </s>
<s> students are approximately equally divided between those who regard vocational preparation as the primary goal of an ideal education and those who chose a general liberal education </s>
<s> other conceivable goals such as character-education and social adjustment are of secondary importance to them </s>
<s> the ideal of a liberal education impresses itself upon the students more and more as they move through college </s>
<s> even in such technical curricula as engineering the senior is much more likely than the freshman to choose as an ideal liberal education over specific vocational preparation </s>
<s> students choices of ideal educational goals are not arbitrary or whimsical </s>
<s> there is a clear relationship between their educational evaluations and their basic pattern of general values </s>
<s> the same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational choices </s>
<s> and contrary to many popular assertions the goal-values chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic success nor to mere conformity </s>
<s> our students want occupations that permit them to use their talents and training to be creative and original to work with and to help other people </s>
<s> they also want money prestige and security </s>
<s> but they are optimistic about their prospects in these regards </s>
<s> within the fixed frame of these aspirations they can afford to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power prestige and wealth </s>
<s> the purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute </s>
<s> furthermore many reluctant recruits are yielding to social demands or compromising in the face of their own limitations of opportunity or of ability and performance </s>
<s> thus many a creativity-oriented aspirant for a career in architecture drama or journalism resigns himself to a real estate business </s>
<s> and many a hopeful incipient business executive decides it were better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice it </s>
<s> in their views on dating courtship sex and family life our students prefer what they are expected to prefer </s>
<s> for them in the grim words of a once-popular song love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage </s>
<s> but these terms are treacherous </s>
<s> in the field of political values it is certainly true that students are not radical not rebels against their parents or their peers </s>
<s> and as they go through college the students tend to bring their political position in line with that prevalent in the social groups to which they belong </s>
<s> the students who are most willing to acquiesce in the suppression of civil liberties are also those who are most likely to be prejudiced against minority groups to be conformist and traditionalistic in general social attitudes and to lack a basic faith in people </s>
<s> but the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen </s>
<s> this finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties than the other students </s>
<s> there is now substantial evidence from several major studies of college students that the experience of the college years results in a certain selective homogenization of attitudes and values </s>
<s> detached from their prior statuses and social groups and exposed to the pervasive stimuli of the university milieu the students tend to assimilate a new common culture to converge toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus </s>
<s> furthermore in certain respects there are norms common to colleges and universities across the country </s>
<s> for instance college-educated people consistently show up in study after study as more often than others supporters of the bill of rights and other democratic rights and liberties </s>
<s> the interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which students tend to converge include toleration of diversity </s>
<s> our data indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing institutions of the society and in the face of the realities of complex and large-scale economic and political problems make a wary and ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of legitimized responsibility for coping with such collective concerns </s>
<s> although we have no measures of its strength or intensity the heritage of the doctrine of inalienable rights is retained </s>
<s> in this sense also they are surely conformists </s>
<s> but the extent of ethical robotism is easily overestimated </s>
<s> few students are really so faceless in the not-so-lonely crowd of the swelling population in our institutions of higher learning </s>
<s> in the field of religious beliefs and values the college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding culture </s>
<s> their commitments are for the most part couched in a familiar idiom </s>
<s> students testify to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate personal philosophy </s>
<s> avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as to be a curiosity </s>
<s> the religious quest is often intense and deep and there are students on every campus who are seriously wrestling with the most profound questions of meaning and value </s>
<s> at the same time a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means of personal adjustment an anchor for family life a source of emotional security </s>
<s> these personal and social goals often overshadow the goals of intellectual clarity and spiritual transcendence </s>
<s> still another segment of the student population consists of those who seek in what they regard as religion intellectual clarity rational belief and ethical guidance and reinforcement </s>
<s> our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly orthodox and religiously involved </s>
<s> as we looked more intently at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation we received the impression that many of the religious convictions expressed represented a conventional acceptance of low intensity </s>
<s> but here again comparative benchmarks are lacking and we do not know in any case what measure of profoundity and intensity to expect from healthy young secure and relatively inexperienced persons </s>
<s> after all feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions of youth </s>
<s> nor are optimistic and socially-oriented themes at all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country </s>
<s> a variety of data are assembled to bear upon such alleged changes as diminished puritan morality work-success ethic individualism achievement lessened emphasis on future-time orientation in favor of sociability moral relativism consideration and tolerance conformity hedonistic present-time orientation </s>
<s> there was much sickness in the corps and the men were in addition without the clothing shoes and blankets needed for the winter weather </s>
<s> morgan himself had sciatica again </s>
<s> even on his tough constitution the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest </s>
<s> although the fort was evacuated in the face of the force of cornwallis morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing at the redcoats </s>
<s> a few days later it was learned that general howe was planning an attack upon the american camp </s>
<s> the british general moved his forces north from philadelphia to chestnut hill near the right wing of the patriot encampment </s>
<s> here the pennsylvania militia skirmished with the british but soon fled </s>
<s> morgan was ordered to attack the enemy who had meantime moved to edge hill on the left of the americans </s>
<s> similar orders were given to the maryland militia </s>
<s> morgan immediately disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait </s>
<s> now the riflemen and the marylanders followed up their beginning and closed in on the british giving them another telling round of fire </s>
<s> the redcoats ran like rabbits </s>
<s> but the maryland militia had likewise fled all too typical of this type of soldier during the revolution an experience which gave morgan little confidence in militia in general as he watched other instances of their breaking in hot engagements </s>
<s> the british although suffering considerable losses noted the defection of the marylanders made a stand then turned and attacked morgan who became greatly outnumbered and had to retire </s>
<s> the latter was so upset on learning of the death of morris that he wrote morgan a letter showing his own warmhearted generosity </s>
<s> after complimenting morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to congress too the ardent frenchman added he felt that congress should make some financial restitution to the widow and family of morris but that he knew morgan realized how long such action usually required if it was done at all </s>
<s> if she wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of congress it would not become a stranger unknown to her to offer himself for that purpose </s>
<s> this was accordingly done and the plight of the grateful mrs morris was much relieved as a result of the generous loan the amount of which is not known </s>
<s> apparently still sensitive about the idea with which general gates had approached him at saratoga namely that george washington be replaced morgan was vehement in his support of the commander-in-chief during the campaign around philadelphia </s>
<s> richard peters secretary of the board of war thought morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying to pick a quarrel </s>
<s> morgan hotly denied this and informed the board of war that the men in camp linked the name of peters with the plot against washington </s>
<s> the position of the new camp was admirably selected and well fortified its easily defensible nature being one good reason why howe did not attack it </s>
<s> in order to see that this hindering situation remained effective washington detached several bodies of his troops to the periphery of the philadelphia area </s>
<s> morgan and his corps were placed on the west side of the schuylkill river with instructions to intercept all supplies found going to the city and to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy </s>
<s> the headquarters of morgan was on a farm said to have been particularly well located so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the british a practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for british gold rather than the virtually worthless continental currency </s>
<s> in his dealings with offenders however morgan was typically firm but just </s>
<s> for example he captured some persons from york county who with teams were taking to philadelphia the furniture of a man who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife and who apparently was helpless to prevent the theft of his household goods </s>
<s> morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its thankful owners but he let the culprits who had stolen it go free </s>
<s> morgan complained to washington about the men detailed to him for scouting duty most of them he said being useless </s>
<s> if the hardships of the winter at valley forge were trying for healthy men they were of course much more so for those not in good health </s>
<s> he had braved the elements and the enemy but the strain aided by the winter was catching up with him at last </s>
<s> also he was now forty-three years old </s>
<s> the mild activity of his command during the sojourn of the troops at valley forge could be handled by a subordinate he felt so like henry knox equally loyal to washington who went to boston at this time morgan received permission to visit his home in virginia for several weeks </s>
<s> in his absence the rifle regiment was under the command of major thomas posey another able virginian </s>
<s> he was shown a warm welcome regardless and spent the time in winchester recuperating from his ailment enjoying his family and arranging his private affairs which were of course run down </s>
<s> the dreary camp at valley forge was turned into an arena of rejoicing </s>
<s> even the dignified washington indulged in a game of wickets with some children </s>
<s> his soldiers on the whole did not celebrate so mildly </s>
<s> these were oneida indians </s>
<s> meantime however this same general smallwood seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the american army </s>
<s> ford urged morgan to capture these men who he thought might be disguised as quakers or peasants </s>
<s> morgan took the suggested steps but when mrs sanderson appeared there was nobody with her but her husband whom he promptly sent to headquarters to be questioned </s>
<s> but morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence much more important to his commanding general </s>
<s> it is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures on the pope </s>
<s> nogaret is hardly an impartial witness and even he did not make his charges against boniface until the latter was dead but there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say </s>
<s> the pope was playing a dangerous game with so many balls in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage of every change in the delicate balance of european affairs </s>
<s> when the negotiations began his quarrel with the king of france was temporarily in abeyance and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there was hope that french money would come to pay the troops who under charles of valois the papal vicar of tuscany were so valuable in the crusade against the colonna cardinals and their sicilian allies </s>
<s> on the other hand he did not want to offend edward either and he found himself in a very difficult position </s>
<s> on the surface the whole question was purely feudal </s>
<s> the french were now occupying gascony and flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited them by a breach of the feudal contract </s>
<s> but edward was invading scotland for precisely the same reason and his insubordinate vassal was the ally of the king of france </s>
<s> boniface had to uphold the sacredness of the feudal contract at all costs for it was only as suzerain of sicily and of the patrimony of peter that he had any justification for his italian wars but in the english-scottish-french triangle it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those of the other two </s>
<s> because of these involvements in the matter at stake boniface lacked the impartiality that is supposed to be an essential qualification for the position of arbiter and in retrospect that would seem to be sufficient reason why the english embassies to the curia proved so fruitless </s>
<s> he was a learned and brilliant man one of the best jurists in europe and with flashes of penetrating insight and yet in his dealings with other people particularly when he tried to be ingratiating he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives </s>
<s> they had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence and astuteness they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles like othon or even the older generation of clerks like hotham and they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized </s>
<s> boniface was later to explain to the english that robert of burgundy and guy de st-pol were easy enough to do business with </s>
<s> it was the clerks who caused the mischief and who made him say that the ruling passion of their race was covetousness and that in dealing with them he never knew whether he had to do with a frenchman or with a devil </s>
<s> and yet he made no pretense about it </s>
<s> loyal and unscrupulous with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies he outmatched the english diplomats time and time again until by a kind of poetic justice he fell at the battle of courtrai the victim of the equally nationalistic if less articulate flemings </s>
<s> the english relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior diplomatic skill were also hampered in their negotiations by the events that were taking place at home </s>
<s> he was unable to send any more help to his allies on the continent and during the next few years many of them left to resist french pressure unaided surrendered to the inevitable and made their peace with philip </s>
<s> the defeat and death of adolf of nassau at the hands of albert of habsburg also worked to the disadvantage of the english for all the efforts to revive the anti-french coalition came to nothing when philip made an alliance with the new king of the romans </s>
<s> these shifts in alliance and allegiance not only increased the difficulties confronting the english embassy as a whole but also directly involved the two savoyards amadee and othon </s>
<s> in spite of the armistice negotiated by amadee two years earlier the war between bishop guillaume of lausanne and louis of savoy was still going on and although little is known about it that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle against french expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict </s>
<s> amadee may have owed this partly to his relationship with the king but othon who at sixty seems still to have been a simple knight merited his position solely by his own character and ability </s>
<s> this also gave them the unpleasant duty of being spokesmen for the mission and they could foresee that that would not be easy </s>
<s> underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys was the inescapable fact that edward would have to desert his flemish allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain the king of france in return for being given an equally free hand with the insubordinate scots </s>
<s> this was a doubly bitter blow to the king </s>
<s> bad relations between england and flanders brought hard times to the shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded flemish cities and while the english so far had done no more than grumble othon had seen what the discontent might lead to for before he left the low countries the citizens of ghent had risen in protest against the expense of supporting edward and his troops and the regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the nasty little riot that ensued </s>
<s> in all the talk of feudal rights the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers nor was it easy to do so for all along the road to italy they passed the florentine pack trains going home with their loads of raw wool from england and rough flemish cloth the former to be spun and woven by the arte della lana and the latter to be refined and dyed by the arte della calimala with the pigment recently discovered in asia minor by one of their members bernardo rucellai the secret of which they jealously kept for themselves </s>
<s> these chatty merchants made amusing and instructive traveling companions for their business took them to all four corners of the globe and florentine gossip had already reached a high stage of development as even a cursory glance at the inferno will prove </s>
<s> a northern ambassador willing to keep his mouth shut and his ears open could learn a lot that would stand him in good stead at the curia </s>
<s> they had other topics of conversation besides their news from courts and fairs which were of interest to othon the builder of castles in wales and churches in his native country </s>
<s> the low countries where the middle ages were to last for another two centuries and die out only when charles the bold of burgundy met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls of grandson </s>
<s> it usually turned out well for him because either he liked the right people or there were only a few wrong people in the town </s>
<s> it was a very tempting offer </s>
<s> in spite of his being well liked there were a few people who were very careful about alfred </s>
<s> one of the people who was afraid of alfred was his own brother lew </s>
<s> everything was all very friendly except when it came to harry the youngest brother </s>
<s> alfred who was a good deal older than harry had treated him like a son and when harry decided to stay in business with lew instead of going with alfred alfred looked on the decision as a betrayal </s>
<s> the six miles between the towns became an ocean and the alperts became a family of strangers </s>
<s> time went on and everybody got older </s>
<s> i became fifteen sixteen then twenty and still tessie alpert sat on the porch with a rose in her hair and alfred got richer and sicker with diabetes </s>
<s> they were like two strangers </s>
<s> the store was their marriage and when alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold them together </s>
<s> tessie everybody thought was a strong woman but she was only strong because she had alfred to lean on </s>
<s> tessie could do nothing for alfred </s>
<s> instead she waited for alfred to get better and take care of her </s>
<s> alfred knew that too </s>
<s> alfred began to put his affairs in order and he went about it like a man putting his things into storage </s>
<s> my father who liked alfred very much was a constant visitor </s>
<s> one day alfred told him that he had decided to leave everything to me </s>
<s> my father a wise man asked him not to </s>
<s> he knew alfred liked me </s>
<s> if he wanted to leave me something let it be a trinket nothing else </s>
<s> alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home </s>
<s> the doctor wanted him in a hospital </s>
<s> the nearest one was forty miles away in kingston </s>
<s> the day alfred left his home and fleischmanns he gave up the convictions of a lifetime </s>
<s> he sent me for meltzer the butcher whom he wanted not as a friend but as a rabbi </s>
<s> meltzer knew why i had come for him </s>
<s> for a few minutes there was nothing to hear </s>
<s> meltzer stayed with alfred and when the door opened they both came out </s>
<s> alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital </s>
<s> the car was waiting for him </s>
<s> alfred leaning on meltzer stopped for a minute to look at tessie </s>
<s> alfred nodded a little nod and went out through the door </s>
<s> alfred walked past him without a word and got into the car </s>
<s> harry ran to the side of the car where alfred was sitting and looked at him begging him to speak </s>
<s> alfred looked straight ahead </s>
<s> alfred </s>
<s> but the car moved off and alfred just looked straight ahead </s>
<s> harry followed the car until it reached the main road and turned towards kingston </s>
<s> he stood there watching until it had gone from his sight </s>
<s> i went to visit alfred in the kingston hospital a few times </s>
<s> mr banks was always called banks the butcher until he left town and the shop passed over to meltzer the scholar who then became automatically meltzer the butcher </s>
<s> meltzer was a boarder with the banks family </s>
<s> he came to fleischmanns directly from the boat that brought him to america from russia </s>
<s> he was a learned man and a very gentle soul </s>
<s> he was filled with knowledge of the bible and the talmud </s>
<s> he knew the whyfores and the wherefores but he was weak very weak on the therefores </s>
<s> banks the butcher took meltzer the scholar as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must be able to do more than just quote the commentaries of the talmud in order to live </s>
<s> so meltzer learned a new trade from banks who supplied the town and the hotels with meat </s>
<s> the daughter lilly was a very good friend of mine and i always had hopes that someday she and meltzer would find each other </s>
<s> he treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt </s>
<s> perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that hung silently from his hooks </s>
<s> lilly banks and i became friends </s>
<s> her brother karl was a very gentle soul her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard probing eyes </s>
<s> every chance i got i left the hotel to visit lilly </s>
<s> i was free but she was bound to her duties that not even the coming of meltzer lightened </s>
<s> she had to clean the glass on the display cases in the butcher shop help her brother scrub the cutting tables with wire brushes mop the floors put down new sawdust on the floors and help check the outgoing orders </s>
<s> when these chores were finished only then was she allowed whatever freedom she could find </s>
<s> i helped lilly in the store </s>
<s> to me it was a game to her it was the deadly seriousness of life </s>
<s> i wanted to help so that we could find time to play </s>
<s> and lilly allowed me to help so that she could have her few little hours of escape </s>
<s> when the work was finished we would walk </s>
<s> the road past the butcher shop took us along the side of a stream </s>
<s> it ran north away from the town and the people through woods and past the nothingness of a graveyard </s>
<s> lilly preferred the loneliness of that walk </s>
<s> i would have liked the town and the busyness of its people but i always followed lilly into the peace of the silent and unstaring road </s>
<s> to me lilly was a fine and lovely girl </s>
<s> she had the hips of a boy and a loose-jointed walk that reminded me of a string of beads strolling down the street </s>
<s> and she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked </s>
<s> it was unexpected unexpected because lilly walked with her head bent down down and her mark of friendship was to look into your face </s>
<s> i accepted her crossed eyes as she accepted my childishness </s>
<s> childishness compared to her grown-up understanding that life was a punishment for as yet undisclosed sins </s>
<s> we were almost the same age she was fifteen i was twelve and where i felt there was a life to look forward to lilly felt she had had as much of it as was necessary </s>
<s> karl was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it was strange to see the expected become the unexpected </s>
<s> this huge hulk played the guitar and he would take it along on our walks and play for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream </s>
<s> karl played well and his favorite song was a schubert lullaby </s>
<s> he spoke no german but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew in a foreign language </s>
<s> the brother and sister seemed to be a sort of mutual-aid society a little fortress of kindness for each other in a hard world </s>
<s> i felt very flattered to be included in the protection of their company even though i had nothing to be protected from </s>
<s> the turn of the century or to be more precise the two decades preceeding and following it marks a great change in the history of early english scholarship </s>
<s> at the bottom of this change were great strides forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the historian </s>
<s> in archaeology for example the contributions of frederick haverfield and reginald smith to the various volumes of the victoria county histories raised the discipline from the status of an antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the early english historian </s>
<s> and with the publication of e t leeds archaeology of the anglo-saxon settlements the student was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data then known </s>
<s> what was true for archaeology was also true of place-name studies </s>
<s> the value of place-names in the reconstruction of early english history had long been recognized </s>
<s> place-names in fact had been extensively utilized for this purpose from the time of camden onwards </s>
<s> without a precise knowledge of germanic philology however it is debatable whether their use was not more often a source of confusion and error than anything else </s>
<s> even in the nineteenth century such accomplished philologists as kemble and guest were led into what now seem ludicrous errors because of their failure to recognize that modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical philological development </s>
<s> diplomatic is another area for which the dawn of the twentieth century marks the beginning of modern standards of scholarship </s>
<s> although because of the important achievements of nineteenth century scholars in the field of textual criticism the advance is not so striking as it was in the case of archaeology and place-names the editorial principles laid down by stevenson in his great edition of asser and in his crawford charters were a distinct improvement upon those of his predecessors and remain unimproved upon today </s>
<s> in sum it can be said that the techniques and standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century </s>
<s> and it is this particularly the establishment of archaeology and place-name studies on a scientific basis which are immediately pertinent to the saxon shore </s>
<s> even before the century was out the tide of reaction had set in </s>
<s> early in the present century w h stevenson continued the attack with a savage article against guest </s>
<s> following him in varying degrees of scepticism were tw shore hm chadwick thomas hodgkin and f g beck </s>
<s> it would seem that the wheel had turned full circle </s>
<s> in fact modern scholarly opinion in the main has not retreated all the way back to the destructive scepticism of the first half of the nineteenth century </s>
<s> although one meets with occasional extremists like zachrisson or very recently arthur wade-evans the majority of scholars have taken a middle position between the extremes of scepticism and gullibility </s>
<s> most now admit that bede gildas nennius and the anglo-saxon chronicles cannot be the infallible guides to early english history that guest freeman and green thought them to be </s>
<s> on the other hand the consensus of opinion is that used with caution and in conjunction with other types of evidence the native sources still provide a valid rough outline for the english settlement of southern britain </s>
<s> therefore in one way kemble and lappenberg have been vindicated </s>
<s> their conclusions concerning the untrustworthiness of the west saxon annals the confused chronology of bede the unreliability of the early positions of the anglo-saxon genealogies and the mythological elements contained in nennius are now mostly accepted </s>
<s> nevertheless in another way modern historians still labor in the vineyard of the oxford school </s>
<s> at this point of course the issue has become complicated by a development unforeseen by lappenberg and kemble </s>
<s> they however much they were in disagreement with the late victorians over the method by which britain was germanized agreed with them that the end result was the complete extinction of the previous celtic population and civilization </s>
<s> against seebohm formidable foes have taken the field notably f w maitland whose domesday book and beyond was written expressly for this purpose and sir paul vinogradoff whose the growth of the manor had a similar aim </s>
<s> largely due to their efforts the catastrophic invasion-theory has maintained its position although seebohm has always found supporters </s>
<s> this is nevertheless a minority view </s>
<s> therefore it is plain that the clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us </s>
<s> in the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars hm chadwick rh hodgkin sir frank stenton et al who are in varying degrees sceptical of the native traditions of the conquest but who defend the catastrophic type of invasion suggested by them </s>
<s> they in effect have compromised the opposing positions of the nineteenth century </s>
<s> on the other side are the celtic survivalists who have taken a tack divergent from both these schools of nineteenth century thought </s>
<s> as a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual germanic infiltration although the specialist nature of much of their work eg seebohm gray and finberg tends to obscure their sympathies </s>
<s> those who do have occasion to deal with the invasions in a more general way like tw shore and arthur wade-evans are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful germanic penetration into britain </s>
<s> now omitting for a moment some recent developments we can say the saxon shore hypothesis of lappenberg and kemble has undergone virtual eclipse in this century </s>
<s> one reason is of course that the new scepticism has been willing to maintain the general picture of the invasions as portrayed in the traditional sources </s>
<s> moreover they have done so in rather special circumstances </s>
<s> even earlier haverfield had come to the same conclusion </s>
<s> what they meant was that there was no evidence to show that the south and east coasts of britain received germanic settlers conspicuously earlier than some other parts of england </s>
<s> that is there was no trace of anglo-saxons in britain as early as the late third century to which time the archaeological evidence for the erection of the saxon shore forts was beginning to point </s>
<s> in recent years however a wind of change seems to be blowing through early english historical circles </s>
<s> the great increase in the amount of archaeological activity and therefore information in the years immediately preceeding and following the second world war has brought to light data which has changed the complection of the saxon shore dispute </s>
<s> we must therefore have a look at the new archaeological material and re-examine the literary and place-name evidence which bears upon the problem </s>
<s> we know that the saxon shore was a phenonenon of late roman defensive policy </s>
<s> in other words its existence belongs to the period of roman britain </s>
<s> so whenever the romans finally withdrew from the island the saxon shore disappeared in the first decade of the fifth century </s>
<s> my argument is that there was no saxon shore prior to that time even though the forts had been in existence since the time of carausius </s>
<s> therefore what we must prove or disprove is that there were saxons in the broad sense in which we must construe the word in the area of the saxon shore at the time it was called the saxon shore </s>
<s> that is we must find saxons in east anglia kent sussex and hampshire in the last half of the fourth century </s>

<s> in gaul the saxon element on its saxon shore was plainly visible because there the saxons were an intrusive element in the population </s>

<s> there was no time in the short mexican encounter to evolve a solution but the area provided a proving ground for new departures in the near future </s>

<s> we no longer use the particular terms of lessing and victor hugo </s>
<s> but we abide by their insight </s>
<s> the sense of relationship overreaches the historical truth that shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual works of aeschylus sophocles and euripides </s>
<s> it transcends the glaring fact that the elizabethans mixed tragedy and comedy whereas the greeks kept the two modes severely distinct </s>
<s> it overcomes our emphatic awareness of the vast difference in the shape and fabric of the two languages and styles of dramatic presentation </s>
<s> the intimations of a related spirit and ordering of human values are stronger than any sense of disparity </s>
<s> comparable visions of life are at work in antigone and romeo and juliet </s>
<s> we see at once what victor hugo means when he calls macbeth a northern scion of the house of atreus </s>
<s> elsinore seems to lie in a range of mycenae and the fate of orestes resounds in that of hamlet </s>
<s> oedipus and lear attain similar insights by virtue of similar blindness </s>
<s> it is not between euripides and shakespeare that the western mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense of life </s>
<s> it is after the late seventeenth century </s>
<s> the image of man which enters into force with aeschylus is still vital in phedre and athalie </s>
<s> it is the triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysics which marks the point of no return </s>
<s> shakespeare is closer to sophocles than he is to pope and voltaire </s>
<s> to say this is to set aside the realness of time </s>
<s> but it is true nevertheless </s>
<s> the modes of the imagination implicit in athenian tragedy continued to shape the life of the mind until the age of descartes and newton </s>
<s> it is only then that the ancient habits of feeling and the classic orderings of material and psychological experience were abandoned </s>
<s> in greek tragedy as in shakespeare mortal actions are encompassed by forces which transcend man </s>
<s> the reality of orestes entails that of the furies </s>
<s> the weird sisters wait for the soul of macbeth </s>
<s> we cannot conceive of oedipus without a sphinx nor of hamlet without a ghost </s>
<s> the shadows cast by the personages of greek and shakespearean drama lengthen into a greater darkness </s>
<s> and the entirety of the natural world is party to the action </s>
<s> the thunderclaps over the sacred wood at colonus and the storms in king lear are caused by more than weather </s>
<s> in tragedy lightning is a messenger </s>
<s> the tragic stage is a platform extending precariously between heaven and hell </s>
<s> those who walk on it may encounter at any turn ministers of grace or damnation </s>
<s> oedipus and lear instruct us how little of the world belongs to man </s>
<s> mortality is the pacing of a brief and dangerous watch and to all sentinels whether at elsinore or on the battlements at mycenae the coming of dawn has its breath of miracle </s>
<s> it banishes the night wanderers to fire or repose </s>
<s> modern roosters have lost the art of crowing restless spirits back to purgatory </s>
<s> the wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre </s>
<s> from it spokes of order and degree led to the outward rim of the common man </s>
<s> tragedy presumes such a configuration </s>
<s> its sphere is that of royal courts dynastic quarrels and vaulting ambitions </s>
<s> the same metaphors of swift ascent and calamitous decline apply to oedipus and macbeth because they applied also to alcibiades and essex </s>
<s> and the fate of such men has tragic relevance because it is public </s>
<s> agamemnon creon and medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes of the polis </s>
<s> similarly the sufferings of hamlet othello or phedre engage the fortunes of the state </s>
<s> they are enacted at the heart of the body politic </s>
<s> hence the natural setting of tragedy is the palace gate the public square or the court chamber </s>
<s> princes and factions clashed in the open street and died on the open scaffold </s>
<s> with the rise to power of the middle class the centre of gravity in human affairs shifted from the public to the private </s>
<s> the art of defoe and richardson is founded on an awareness of this great change </s>
<s> heretofore an action had possessed the breadth of tragedy only if it involved high personages and if it occurred in the public view </s>
<s> behind the tragic hero stands the chorus the crowd or the observant courtier </s>
<s> in la nouvelle-heloise and werther tragedy is made intimate </s>
<s> and private tragedy became the chosen ground not of drama but of the new unfolding art of the novel </s>
<s> the novel was not only the presenter of the new secular rationalistic private world of the middle class </s>
<s> it served also as a literary form exactly appropriate to the fragmented audience of modern urban culture </s>
<s> i have said before how difficult it is to make any precise statements with regard to the character of the greek and elizabethan public </s>
<s> but one major fact seems undeniable </s>
<s> until the advent of rational empiricism the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic and allegoric </s>
<s> available evidence regarding the natural world the course of history and the varieties of human action were translated into imaginative designs or mythologies </s>
<s> classic mythology and christianity are such architectures of the imagination </s>
<s> they order the manifold levels of reality and moral value along an axis of being which extends from brute matter to the immaculate stars </s>
<s> there had not yet supervened between understanding and expression the new languages of mathematics and scientific formulas </s>
<s> the poet was by definition a realist his imaginings and parables being natural organizations of reality </s>
<s> and in these organizations certain primal notions played a radiant part radiant both in the sense of giving light and of being a pole toward which all perspectives converge </s>
<s> i refer to the notion that the structure of society is a microcosm of the cosmic design and that history conforms to patterns of justice and chastisement as if it were a morality play set in motion by the gods for our instruction </s>
<s> these conceptions and the manner in which they were transposed into poetry or engendered by poetic form are intrinsic to western life from the time of aeschylus to that of shakespeare </s>
<s> and although they were as i have indicated under increasing strain at the time of racine they are still alive in his theatre </s>
<s> they are the essential force behind the conventions of tragedy </s>
<s> they are as decisively present in the oresteia and oedipus as in macbeth king lear and phedre </s>
<s> after the seventeenth century the audience ceased to be an organic community to which these ideas and their attendant habits of figurative language would be natural or immediately familiar </s>
<s> concepts such as grace damnation purgation blasphemy or the chain of being which are everywhere implicit in classic and shakespearean tragedy lose their vitality </s>
<s> they become philosophic abstractions of a private and problematic relevance or mere catchwords in religious customs which had in them a diminishing part of active belief </s>
<s> after shakespeare the master spirits of western consciousness are no longer the blind seers the poets or orpheus performing his art in the face of hell </s>
<s> they are descartes newton and voltaire </s>
<s> and their chroniclers are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists </s>
<s> the romantics were the immediate inheritors of this tremendous change </s>
<s> they were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable </s>
<s> from this action sprang the idea of somehow uniting greek and shakespearean drama into a new total form capable of restoring to life the ancient moral and poetic responses </s>
<s> the dream of achieving a synthesis between the sophoclean and the shakespearean genius inspired the ambitions of poets and composers from the time of shelley and victor hugo to that of bayreuth </s>
<s> it could not really be fulfilled </s>
<s> the conventions into which the romantics tried to breath life no longer corresponded to the realities of thought and feeling </s>
<s> but the attempt itself produced a number of brilliant works and these form a transition from the early romantic period to the new age of ibsen and chekhov </s>
<s> the dream of a descent into the gardens of the south always drew german ambitions toward rome and sicily </s>
<s> goethe asks in wilhelm meister whether we know the land where the lemon trees flower and the light of the mediterranean glows through torquato tasso and the roman elegies </s>
<s> goethe believed that the germanic spirit with its grave strength but flagrant streaks of brutality and intolerance should be tempered with the old sensuous wisdom and humanism of the hellenic </s>
<s> on the narrower ground of poetic form he felt that in the drama of the future the greek conception of tragic fate should be joined to the shakespearean vision of tragic will </s>
<s> the wager between god and satan brings on the destiny of faust but faust assumes his role voluntarily </s>
<s> it tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest wisdom joined to the highest sensual beauty </s>
<s> there can be no greater magic than to wrest from death her in whom the flesh was all in whom beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely corruptible </s>
<s> goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends </s>
<s> faust rescuing helen from menelaus vengeance is the genius of renaissance europe restoring to life the classic tradition </s>
<s> this seems to refer not to the loan richard had asked for but to a proposed bargain with shakespeare </s>
<s> william parsons and william walford drapers asked quiney to see to business matters in london </s>
<s> he asked quiney to find out whether the money had been paid and if not to send to the lodging of sir edward and entreat him to pay what he owed </s>
<s> further letters in november mention that sir edward paid forty pounds </s>
<s> and i was six days going thither and coming homewards </s>
<s> he was allowed forty-four pounds in all including fees to the masters of requests mr fanshawe of the exchequer the solicitor general and other officials and their clerks </s>

<s> often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct by those individuals or nations which he is studying </s>
<s> unconsciously governments or races or institutions may enter into some undertaking without fully realizing why they are doing so </s>
<s> they react in obedience to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural law </s>
<s> a court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling that the law is inimical to the numerical majority </s>
<s> a nation may go to war on some trifling pretext when in reality it may have been guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake </s>
<s> when the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible cause and effect sequence he should be alert to intuition and unconscious instinct as possible guides </s>
<s> adams firmly contended that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical environment on history </s>
<s> here was another indispensable tool </s>
<s> the failure of greece to reach the imperial destiny that periclean athens had seemed to promise was almost directly attributable to her physical conformation </s>
<s> all areas of history were either favorably or adversely affected by the geographical environment and no respectable historian could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of geography </s>
<s> brooks adams was consistent in his admonishments to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess </s>
<s> however as a practicing historian he himself has left few clues to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing history </s>
<s> in fact if judgments are to be rendered upon the soundness of his historicism they must be based on scanty evidence </s>
<s> what evidence is available would seem to indicate that brooks unlike his older brother henry had most of the methodological vices usually found in the amateur </s>
<s> a credulousness a distaste for documentation an uncritical reliance on contemporary accounts and a proneness to assume a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all evidences of his failure to comprehend the use of the scientific method or to evaluate the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public </s>
<s> this is not to assume that his work was without merit but the validity of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be considered against this background of an unprofessional approach </s>
<s> his credulity is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to the emancipation of massachusetts which purports to examine the trials of moses and to draw a parallel between the leader of the israelite exodus from egypt and the leadership of the puritan clergy in colonial new england </s>
<s> in light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by the higher criticism this is a most remarkable statement particularly coming from one who was well known for his antifundamentalist views </s>
<s> the desire to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique smacks more of the propagandist than the historian </s>
<s> a similar amateurish characteristic is revealed in adams failure to check the accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources </s>
<s> if he found data that fitted his general plan he used it and counted his sources trustworthy </s>
<s> conversely if statistics were uncovered which contradicted a cherished theory the sources were denounced as faulty </s>
<s> such manipulations are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression of the monasteries during the english reformation </s>
<s> adams depended largely on the dispatches of foreign ambassadors and observers in england claiming that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because there were no newspapers </s>
<s> this is certainly an irrational dogmatism in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the sixteenth century on twentieth-century terms </s>
<s> what is exposited by this observation is not the inherent prejudices of englishmen but the anglophobia of brooks adams </s>
<s> in all fairness it must be admitted that adams made no pretense at being an impartial historian </s>
<s> impartiality to him meant an unwillingness to generalize and to search for a synthesis </s>
<s> ranke and his disciples had reduced history to a profession of dullness </s>
<s> brooks adams preferred the chronicles of froissart or the style and theorizing of edward gibbon for at least they took a stand on the issues about which they wrote </s>
<s> he wrote eloquently to william james that impartial history was not only impossible but undesirable </s>
<s> if the historian was convinced of his own correctness then he should not allow his vision to become fogged by disturbing facts </s>
<s> it was history that must be in error not the historian </s>
<s> all of adams work reflects this dogmatic characteristic </s>
<s> no page seems to be complete without the statement of at least one unproved generalization </s>
<s> he cites the french revolution as typifying this rigidity but makes no mention of the italians who have been able to adapt to all types of circumstances </s>
<s> it made no difference that most evidence points to an opposite conclusion </s>
<s> for adams had made up his mind before all the facts were available </s>
<s> all critics of adams and his methods have observed this particular deficiency </s>
<s> a m wergeland called the adams method literally antihistorical while clive day maintained that the assumptions were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight factual evidence </s>
<s> even d a wasson who compared the emancipation of massachusetts to the lifting of a fog from ancient landscapes was also forced to admit the methodological deficiencies of the author </s>
<s> in summary brooks adams felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature </s>
<s> moreover he believed that most professional historians lacked some of the essential instruments for a proper study of history </s>
<s> however despite the insight of many of his observations his own conclusions are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ at all times the correct research methods </s>
<s> this should not prejudice an evaluation of his findings but they were not the findings of a completely impartial investigator </s>
<s> what was perhaps more important than his concept of the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which shaped the direction of his thought </s>
<s> in the final analysis his contribution to american historiography was founded on almost intuitive insights into religion economics and darwinism the three factors which conditioned his search for a law of history </s>
<s> religion without supernaturalism </s>
<s> but it was nothing more than that </s>
<s> religion and the churches were institutions which had been created by man not god </s>
<s> he did not deny god </s>
<s> he simply did not believe that a creator intervened or interfered in human affairs </s>
<s> the historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems suggested by religion </s>
<s> there was no evidence either of a positive or negative type of the actions of a divine being in this world </s>
<s> and since the historian should only be interested in strictly terrestrial activity his research should eliminate the supernatural </s>
<s> furthermore he must regard religion as the expression of human forces </s>
<s> certainly he must recognize its power and attempt to ascertain its influence on the flow of history but he must not confuse the natural and the mundane with the divine </s>
<s> students of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that there was indeed a direct connection </s>
<s> but adams was one of the first to suggest that this human incompetence was the only motivating factor behind religion </s>
<s> it was this fear which explained the development of a priestly caste whose function in society was to mollify and appease the angry deities </s>
<s> to keep themselves entrenched in power the priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle </s>
<s> it was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business </s>
<s> the german barbarians of the fourth century offered an excellent example </s>
<s> this intervention could only be controlled by priests and thus the invasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class </s>
<s> adams contended that once such a special class had been created it became a vested interest and sought to maintain itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between god and man </s>
<s> thus the church was born and because of its intrinsic character was soon identified as a conservative institution determined to resist the forces of change to identify itself with the political rulers and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the masses </s>
<s> doctrine was not only mysterious </s>
<s> these basic ideas concerning the nature of religion were adams believed some of the major keys to the understanding of history and the movement of society </s>
<s> the dark views about the puritans found in the emancipation of massachusetts were never altered </s>
<s> despite their adherence to the status quo the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments as increasing civilization augmented human knowledge </s>
<s> in the law of civilization and decay brooks adams traced this evolution always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more rational the substance remained unchanged </s>
<s> the relic worship and monasticism of the middle ages were more advanced forms than were primitive fetish worship and nature myths </s>
<s> yet the idea imbedded in each was identical to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that class which had been given special dominion over the secrets of god </s>

<s> i could never forget the gaiety with which when he was both blind and deaf he let me lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures </s>
<s> and once when he came to see us in new york he walked away in a rainstorm unwilling to hear of a taxi or even an umbrella although he was at the time ninety years old </s>
<s> there were several men of ninety or more whom i knew first or last all of whom were still productive and most of whom knew one another as if they had naturally come together at the apex of their lives </s>

<s> later rising ninety he was beset by publishers for the story of his life and miracles as he put it but calling himself the needy knife-grinder he had spent his time writing short articles and long letters and could not get even a small popular book done </s>

<s> finally at dawn he fell asleep and when he awoke and came into the living room he found lewis in his pajamas before the fire smoking a cigarette </s>
<s> blackman said that he wanted to apologize for not having prevented lewis from making that horrible spectacle of himself that he should have seized him by the neck at once and forcibly hauled him into his bedroom </s>
<s> lewis warned him never to lay a hand on him and then blackman asked for his fare back to the united states </s>
<s> lewis looked at him and began to cry and then saying that he was going to make a promise he asked blackman to call the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did not want </s>
<s> blackman called the porter and had him remove everything but one bottle of brandy and after that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner or on one of their walking trips beer or in france and italy wine in moderation </s>
<s> lewis gave him a guidebook tour of london and motoring and walking took him to stratford but the london stay was for only ten days and on the twentieth they took the train for southampton where they spent the night for an early morning channel crossing </s>
<s> he suggested that they call on these brothers who received them pleasantly </s>
<s> then they returned to their hotel and got ready for bed </s>
<s> it was late and blackman was ready to go to sleep but lewis was not </s>
<s> earl agreed and lewis said that it would have been very different if his wife had been with him </s>
<s> then he kept blackman awake for more than an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between his wife and himself in which discussing the evening he was continually berated </s>
<s> it is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements whereby these honors lists were then made up or even how the names that they contained assumed the order in which we find them </s>
<s> the process usually began with a tutor boasting about a boy as chappell had boasted about lightfoot to the higher officers of the college and university </s>
<s> then the various officers of the college might take up the case </s>
<s> it would however reach the proctors and other officers in charge of the public-school performances of the incepting bachelors and the place that any individual obtained in the lists depended greatly on how he comported himself in the public schools during his acts therein as he was incepting </s>
<s> of course the higher officials could add or place a name on the list wherever they wished </s>
<s> he evidently earned the place assigned him </s>
<s> of course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of education he received </s>
<s> it differed from what an undergraduate receives today from any american college or university mainly in the certainty of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely scattered information obtained today by most of our undergraduates </s>
<s> milton was required to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge of latin grammar logic-rhetoric ethics physics or natural philosophy metaphysics and latin greek and hebrew </s>
<s> above all he had learned to write formal latin prose and verse to a remarkable degree of artistry </s>
<s> he could produce carefully constructed orations set and formal speeches artfully and prayerfully made by writing and rewriting with all the aid his tutor and others could provide and then delivered verbatim from memory </s>
<s> he also displayed the ability to write latin verse on almost any topic of dispute the verses of course to be delivered from memory </s>
<s> then we have surviving at least one instance of a poem prepared for another in naturam non pati senium and perhaps also the de idea platonica </s>
<s> but his greatest achievement in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues and teachers was his amazing ability to produce literary latin pieces and he was often called on to do so </s>
<s> these were his public academic activities domi forisque in the college and in the university </s>
<s> and his performances attracted much attention as the frequency of his surviving pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his undergraduate activities testifies </s>
<s> his other activities are not so easily recovered </s>
<s> his statements about sports and exercises of a physical nature are suggestive but inconclusive </s>
<s> his later boastings of his skill with the small sword are indicative of much time and practice devoted to the use of that weapon </s>
<s> milton himself uncommunicative as he is about his lesser and nonliterary activities at least gives us some evidence that he was a great walker under any and all conditions </s>
<s> his early poems and some of his prose prolusions speak of wanderings in the city and the neighboring country that may be extended to cambridge and its surrounding countryside </s>
<s> the churches the taverns and the various other places of the town must have known his figure well as he roved to and about them </s>
<s> the tiny hamlet of chesterton to the north with the fens and marshes lying on down the ouse river may have attracted him often as it did many other youths of the time </s>
<s> the gog magog hills to the southeast afforded him and all other students a vantage point from which to view the town and university of their dwelling </s>
<s> the country about cambridge is flat and not particularly spectacular in its scenery though it offers easy going to the foot traveler </s>
<s> ball games especially football required some attention and other organized sports may have attracted him as participant or spectator </s>
<s> he smoked as did everybody and imbibed the various alcoholic beverages of that day although his protestations while at cambridge and after that he was no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence from the wild drinking bouts of some of the undergraduates and we must add of some of their elders including many of the regents or teachers </s>
<s> he was then a slightly built young man of pleasing appearance medium stature and handsome face </s>
<s> a quibusdam audivi nuper domina </s>
<s> that is if we can trust that most specious of prolusions packed as it is with wit and persiflage </s>
<s> the domina sounds real enough if we could only trust the conditions under which we learn of its use </s>
<s> it is not a question of truth or falsity </s>
<s> the mere fact that he was selected though as a substitute to act as interlocutor or moderator for it or perhaps we should say with buck as father of the act is in itself a difficult phase of his development to grasp </s>
<s> milton was to act as the archfool the supreme wit the lightly bantering pater pater liber who could at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment or could at will annihilate the common enemies of the college gathering and with words alone </s>
<s> from an exercise involving merely raucous rough-and-tumble comedy in his hands the performance turned into a revel of wit and word play indecent at times but always learned pointed and carefully aimed at some individuals present and at the whole assembly </s>
<s> to do this successfully required great skill and a special talent for both solemn and ribald raillery a talent not bestowed on many persons but one with which milton was marked as being endowed and in which at least in this performance he obviously reveled </s>
<s> it may be thought unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform if again we may trust the opening of the oratio for it marks the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of witty word play that even in this latin banter has in it the unmistakable element of viciousness and an almost sadistic delight in verbally tormenting an adversary </s>
<s> but the real beginnings of this development in him go back to the opposing of grammar school and probably if it had not been this occasion and these latin lines it would have been some others such as the first prolusion that set off this streak in him of unbridled and scathing verbal attack on an enemy </s>
<s> all western europe would hear and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century </s>
<s> no other names among the young men in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by milton as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted </s>
<s> but that scarcely means that he was the aloof forbidding type of student who shared few if any activities with his fellows the banter of the surviving prolusions providing enough evidence to deny this </s>
<s> perhaps in that short piece or letter written to hartlib in which he sketched his scheme for educating young men he merely overlooked that phase of their exercises </s>
<s> writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot </s>
<s> arriving just in time to stop men from turning their planet into a radioactive wasteland the overlords unite earth into one world in which justice order and benevolence prevail and ignorance poverty and fear have ceased to exist </s>
<s> under their rule earth becomes a technological utopia </s>
<s> mankind as a result attains previously undreamed of levels of civilization and culture a golden age which the overlords a very evident symbol of science have helped produce by introducing reason and the scientific method into human activities </s>
<s> and they have done this on a very large scale with a veritable flood of novels and stories which are either dystopias or narratives of adventure with dystopian elements </s>
<s> what makes the current phenomenon unique is that so many science-fiction writers have reversed a trend and turned to writing works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life </s>
<s> in addition there are many areas of the human situation besides the impact of science and technology which are examined for science-fiction dystopias often extrapolate political social economic tendencies only indirectly related to science and technology </s>
<s> nevertheless with all these qualifications and exceptions the current dystopian phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology instead of bringing utopia may well enslave dehumanize and even destroy men </s>
<s> easily the best known of these three novels is the space merchants a good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more than the impact of science on human life though its most important warning is in this area namely as to the use to which discoveries in the behavioral sciences may be put </s>
<s> the consequences of course have been dreadful reckless expansion has led to overpopulation pollution of the earth and depletion of its natural resources </s>
<s> for example even the most successful executive lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night </s>
<s> soyaburgers have replaced meat and wood has become so precious that it is saved for expensive jewelry </s>
<s> and the atmosphere is so befouled that no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs </s>
<s> thus we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners and the controlled </s>
<s> and the second requirement for convincing people without their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered </s>
<s> indeed again and again the space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners and behavioral scientists once they have seen through human nature will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide them </s>
<s> yet even in the more extreme of such cases we seldom go very far astray in guessing what his age actually is </s>
<s> and this means i suppose that almost invariably age reveals itself by easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind </s>
<s> stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless there </s>
<s> an assumption of youth or the presence of a few youthful characteristics deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed hair </s>
<s> a mind expressing itself in words may reveal itself a little less obviously as old or young </s>
<s> its surface loses its bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious than the body does </s>
<s> youth may be and often is skeptical cynical or despairing </s>
<s> age may be idealistic believing and much given to professions of optimism </s>
<s> but there is nevertheless always a subtle difference in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held </s>
<s> the pessimism of the young is defiant anxious to confess or even exaggerate its ostensible gloom and so exuberant as to reveal the fact that it regards its ability to face up to the awful truth as more than enough to compensate for the awfulness of that truth </s>
<s> similarly the optimism of age protests too much </s>
<s> we may say of some unfortunates that they were never young </s>
<s> we cannot truthfully say of anyone who has succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old </s>
<s> one is that there sometimes are real although inadequate compensations in growing old </s>
<s> serenity if one is fortunate enough to achieve it is not so good as joy but it is something </s>
<s> but at least the question has been raised </s>
<s> many readers of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately even if they have never actually been told what my age is </s>
<s> at least i should like them to know that i know these discounts are being made </s>
<s> i have known some men and women who said that the selves they are told about or even remember seem utter strangers to them now </s>
<s> that their remote past is as discontinuous with their present selves as lacking in any conscious likeness to their mature personality as the self of a butterfly may be imagined discontinuous with that of the caterpillar it once was </s>
<s> for my part i find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs </s>
<s> i have changed and i have reversed opinions </s>
<s> but i am so aware of an uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that i see only as absurd the tendency of some psychologists from heraclitus to pirandello and proust to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which nothing remains unchanged </s>
<s> fundamental values temperament and the way in which one approaches a conviction change less of course than specific opinions </s>
<s> but in ways more fundamental than specific political opinions they are still what they always were passionate sure without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of capable of seeing black and white only and therefore committed to the logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to </s>
<s> but i will also remind them that i have always been inclined to skepticism to a kind of laodicean lack of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned </s>
<s> so that although not as eager as i once was to be disapproved of i can still resist prevailing opinions </s>
<s> at about the age of twelve i became a spencerian liberal and i have always considered myself a liberal of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since spencer became a reactionary </s>
<s> several times in my youth i voted the socialist ticket but less because i was socialist than because i was not either a republican or a democrat and i voted for franklin roosevelt every time he was a candidate </s>
<s> yet during the years when i was on the staff of the nation i tried to the limit the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when i was permitted to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social question </s>
<s> there are few things of which i am prouder than of that unblemished record </s>
<s> many of my friends at the time thought that i had received a well-deserved condemnation when lincoln steffens denounced me in a review of one of my books as a perfect example of the obsolete man who could understand and sympathize only with the dead past </s>
<s> the favorite excuse of those who have now recanted their approval of communism is that they did not know how things would develop </s>
<s> with this excuse i have never been much impressed </s>
<s> there was it seems to me enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of russian leaders to alienate honorable men without their having to wait to see how it would turn out </s>
<s> once many years ago i sat at dinner next to arthur train and the subject of the nation came up </s>
<s> and i suppose it did </s>
<s> i never have been and am not now any kind of utopian </s>
<s> it will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any other phrase or principle could </s>
<s> the reason is i think my awareness that my remarks last quarter on pacifism may well have served to confirm the opinion of some that my tendency to skepticism and dissent gets us nowhere and that i am simply too old to hope </s>
<s> i would however like to suggest that wrong though i may be the tendency to see dilemmas rather than solutions is one of which i have been a victim ever since i can remember and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon </s>
<s> i know that one must act </s>
<s> but one need not always be sure that the action is either wise or conclusive </s>
<s> apropos of what some would call cynicism i remember an anecdote the source of which i forget </s>
<s> it concerns a small-town minister who staged an impressive object lesson by confining a lion and a lamb together in the same cage outside his church door </s>
<s> not only his parishioners but the whole town and ultimately the whole county were enormously impressed by this object lesson </s>
<s> one day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators who wanted to know his secret </s>
<s> there is no trick involved </s>
<s> not really it seems to me </s>
<s> the promise that the lion and the lamb will lie down together was given in the future tense </s>
<s> it is not something that can be expected to happen now </s>
<s> without really changing the general subject i take this opportunity to confess that i am troubled by doubts not only about pacifism but also when asked to join in the protest against a law that most of those who consider themselves humane and liberal seem to regard as obviously barbarous </s>
<s> namely the law that prescribes the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no extenuating circumstances </s>
<s> it is not that i am unaware of the force of their strongest contention </s>
<s> life they say should be regarded as sacred and therefore as something that neither an individual nor his society has a right to take away </s>
<s> in fact i cannot imagine myself condemning a man to the noose or the electric chair if i had to take as an individual the responsibility for his death </s>
<s> just as i know i would make a bad soldier even though i cannot sincerely call myself a pacifist so too i would not be either a hangman by profession or if i could avoid it even a member of a hanging jury </s>
<s> seems to me to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a simple negative answer </s>
<s> punishment of the wrongdoer so liberals are inclined to say can have only three possible justifications revenge reformation or deterrent example </s>
<s> and it should be far better known than it is </s>
<s> even so apparently impartial a critic as w h frohock has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece of loyalist propaganda </s>
<s> nothing however could be farther from the truth </s>
<s> these lines never cease to haunt the book amidst all the exaltations of combat and to make an appeal for a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal necessities of war </s>
<s> malraux to be sure does not abandon the world of violence combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as a creative artist and which is the only world apparently in which his imagination can flame into life </s>
<s> the walnut trees of altenburg includes not one war but two and throws in a turkish revolution along with some guerrilla fighting in the desert for good measure </s>
<s> on the contrary the frenzy and furor of combat is only the sombre foil against which the sudden illuminations of the human flash forth with the piercing radiance of a caravaggio </s>
<s> the walnut trees of altenburg is composed in the form of a triptych with the two small side panels framing and enclosing the main central episode of the novel </s>
<s> this central episode consists of a series of staccato scenes set in the period from the beginning of the present century up to the first world war </s>
<s> like malraux he was also serving in the tank corps before being captured and we learn as well that in civilian life he had been a writer </s>
<s> these biographical analogies are obvious and far too much time has been spent speculating on their possible implications </s>
<s> for as his companions gradually dissolve back into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity as they lose all the appanage of their acquired culture he is overcome by the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind </s>
<s> the intuition about mankind conveyed in these opening pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of the text </s>
<s> and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been done </s>
<s> awkwardly and laboriously in stiff unemotional phrases the soldiers continue to bridge the distance between themselves and those they love </s>
<s> they instinctively struggle to keep open a road to the future in their hearts </s>
<s> this new vision of man that the narrator acquires is also accompanied by a re-vision of his previous view </s>
<s> the human is deeper than a mass ideology certainly deeper than the isolated individual </s>
<s> as an alsatian before the first world war he was of course of german nationality </s>
<s> but he quickly involves himself in the young turk revolutionary movement to such an extent that his own country begins to doubt his patriotism </s>
<s> central asia is sunk in a somnolence from which nothing can awaken it </s>
<s> and amid a dusty desolation in which nothing human any longer seemed to survive vincent berger begins to dream of the occident </s>
<s> trains whistling in the night the rattle and clatter of cabs </s>
<s> this has been his first encounter with mankind and although he has now become a legendary figure in the popular european press it leaves him profoundly dissatisfied </s>
<s> and vincent berger learns that political ambition is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men </s>
<s> but as he discovers shortly on returning among intellectuals obsessed by le culte du moi his experience of action had also taught him a more positive lesson </s>
<s> and when vincent berger returns to europe this first result of his encounters with mankind is considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation </s>
<s> for a dawning sense of illumination occurs in consequence of two events which as so often in malraux suddenly confront a character with the existential question of the nature and value of human life </s>
<s> one such event is the landing in europe itself when the mingled familiarity and strangeness of the occident after the blank immensities of asia shocks the returning traveller into a realization of the infinite possibilities of human life </s>
<s> ordinary methods of diplomacy within the free world are inadequate said the former prime minister </s>
<s> while it is hazardous to project the trend of history it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully emerging in the western world particularly among the countries of western europe </s>
<s> the excesses of nationalism had brought down upon europe a generation of tyranny and war and a return to the old order of things seemed unthinkable </s>
<s> under these conditions a new generation of europeans began to discover the bonds of long association and shared values that for so long had been subordinated to nationalist xenophobia </s>
<s> a slow and painful trend toward unification has taken hold a trend which may at any time be arrested and reversed but which may also lead to a binding federation of europe </s>
<s> it may well be that the unification of europe will prove inadequate that the survival of free society will require nothing less than the confederation of the entire western world </s>
<s> the movement toward european unity has been expressed in two currents federalism and functionalism one looking to the constitution of a united states of europe the other building on wartime precedents of practical cooperation for the solution of specific problems </s>
<s> thus far the advances made have been almost entirely along functional lines </s>
<s> many factors contributed to the growth of the european movement </s>
<s> the united states might well have exploited the opportunity provided by the european recovery program to push the hesitant european nations toward political federation as well as economic cooperation but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the united states government at the time </s>
<s> another powerful factor in the european movement was the threat of soviet aggression </s>
<s> and of course the soviet threat was responsible for nato the grand alliance of the atlantic nations </s>
<s> new organs of unification proliferated in the decade following the conclusion of the nato alliance </s>
<s> the united states and canada belong only to nato and the new oecd </s>
<s> britain until recently went along in some areas with all of the enthusiasm of the groom at a shotgun wedding </s>
<s> in other areas it held back pleading its commonwealth bonds </s>
<s> the time is now ripe indeed overdue for the vigorous development of its non-military potentialities for its development as an instrument of atlantic community </s>
<s> the problem of nato is not one of machinery of which there is an abundance but of the will to use it </s>
<s> the nato council is available as an executive agency the standing group as a high military authority </s>
<s> the unofficial conference of parliamentarians is available as a potential legislative authority </s>
<s> this machinery will not become the instrument of an atlantic community by fiat but only when that community evolves from potentiality to reality </s>
<s> an equally promising avenue toward atlantic community may lie through the development and expansion of the oecd </s>
<s> conceived as an organ of economic cooperation there is no reason why oecd cannot evolve into a broader instrument of union if its members so desire </s>
<s> indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than nato for the development of a parliamentary organ of the atlantic nations because it could encompass all of the members of the atlantic community including those like sweden and switzerland who are unwilling to be associated with an essentially military alliance like aj </s>
<s> underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a conviction that the nations of the north atlantic area do indeed form a community at least a potential community </s>
<s> there is nothing new in this </s>
<s> for centuries the north atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other </s>
<s> the burden of these reflections is that a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs </s>
<s> and if we do not aspire to too much it is also within our capacity </s>
<s> history has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external danger ceases to be dramatically urgent </s>
<s> only when a concert of nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values is it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy </s>
<s> it follows that the solution to the current disunity of the free nations is only to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery of consultation and coordination </s>
<s> it is very much a matter of building the foundations of community </s>
<s> i believe that these proposals however meritorious in terms of world needs go far beyond our capacity to realize them </s>
<s> the defect of these proposals is in their attempt to outrun history and their assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible </s>
<s> a working concept of the organic evolution of community must lead us in a different direction </s>
<s> the failures of the un and of other international organs suggest that we have already gone beyond what was internationally feasible </s>
<s> our problem therefore is to devise processes more modest in their aspirations adjusted to the real world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities </s>
<s> the history of the un demonstrates that in a pluralistic world we must develop processes of influence and persuasion rather than coercion </s>
<s> it is possible that international organization will ultimately supplant the multi-state system but its proper function for the immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to render pluralism more compatible with an interdependent world </s>
<s> the trouble with this machinery is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence of a conscious sense of community among the free nations </s>
<s> our proper objective then is the development of a new spirit the realization of a potential community </s>
<s> constitutions of and by themselves mean little </s>
<s> the history of both the league of nations and the united nations demonstrates that </s>
<s> but a powerful sense of community even with little or no machinery means a great deal </s>
<s> that is the lesson of the nineteenth century </s>
<s> lawrence ferlenghetti and bruce lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical forms of jazz and the vocabulary of the musician </s>
<s> even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry </s>
<s> but the best known exploiters of the new medium are kenneth rexroth and kenneth patchen </s>
<s> rexroth and patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments </s>
<s> rexroth is a longtime jazz buff a name-dropper of jazz heroes and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz </s>
<s> although patchen has given previous evidence of an interest in jazz the musical group that he works with the chamber jazz sextet is often ignored by jazz critics </s>
<s> however his subject matter and basic themes have remained surprisingly consistent and these together with certain key poetic images may be traced through all his work including the new jazz experiments </s>
<s> from the beginning of his career patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry </s>
<s> patchen believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and money-hungry people </s>
<s> running counter to the destroying forces in the world are all the virtues that are innate in man the capacity for love and brotherhood the ability to appreciate beauty </s>
<s> beauty as well as love is redemptive and patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation </s>
<s> this salvation does not take the form of a christian heaven </s>
<s> the dark kingdom sends angels of death and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness </s>
<s> actually heaven and the dark kingdom overlap </s>
<s> they form two aspects of heavenly life after death </s>
<s> patchen has almost never used strict poetic forms </s>
<s> he has experimented instead with personal myth-making </s>
<s> these early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying to patchen </s>
<s> many of his poems purported to be exactly contemporary and political </s>
<s> he is usually something of an underdog he must battle the organized police force as well as recognized criminals </s>
<s> the private detective must rely as the youngest son or trickster hero does in primitive myth on his wits </s>
<s> the private detective is militant against injustice a humorous and ironic explorer of the underworld </s>
<s> most important to patchen he was a non-literary hero and very contemporary </s>
<s> he has become friday on dragnet a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority </s>
<s> he has like so many other secular and religious culture symbols gone over to the side of the ruling classes </s>
<s> it was logical that he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician </s>
<s> the immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger generation must have impressed him and he began working toward the merger of jazz and poetry as he had previously attempted the union of graphic art and poetry </s>
<s> in addition to his experiments in reading poetry to jazz patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the private detective a decade ago </s>
<s> rexroth uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz including many of his chinese and japanese translations </s>
<s> patchen does read some of his earlier works to music but he has written an entire book of short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz </s>
<s> it is difficult to draw the line between stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician </s>
<s> everyone knows that private detectives in real life are not like sam spade and pat novak but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked </s>
<s> seen by the public the musician is the underdog par excellence </s>
<s> he is forced to play for little money and must often take another job to live </s>
<s> his approach to music is highly individualistic </s>
<s> the accent is on improvisation rather than arrangements </s>
<s> while he is worldly the musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment and naivete </s>
<s> the musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal </s>
<s> he is far from being a literary hero yet is a creative artist </s>
<s> many of these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective but where the detective is active and militant the jazz musician is passive almost a victim of society </s>
<s> he must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world but who declines doing anything about it </s>
<s> he has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest symbols and devices to the new work and the fact that he has kept a body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected continuity to his poetry </s>
<s> his revolutionary anger is apparent in most of his early poems </s>
<s> i was born angry </s>
<s> angry that my father was being burnt alive in the mills </s>
<s> angry that none of us knew anything but filth and poverty </s>
<s> this angry and exasperated stance which patchen has maintained in his poetry for almost fifteen years has been successfully modulated into a kind of woe that is as effective as anger and still expresses his disapproval of the modern world </s>
<s> although it does not follow the metrical rules for a blues to be sung the phrases themselves carry a blues feeling </s>
<s> yes i went to the city and there i did bitterly cry men out of touch with the earth and with never a glance at the sky </s>
<s> neither of these poems is an aberration </s>
<s> patchen is repeatedly preoccupied with death </s>
<s> in many of his poems death comes by train a strongly evocative visual image </s>
<s> let us see just how typical krim is </s>
<s> he is new york-born and jewish </s>
<s> he spent one year at the university of north carolina because thomas wolfe went there </s>

<s> they read widely and eclectically </s>
<s> they did not fall into pseudo-glamorous jobs on pseudo-glamorous magazines but they did whatever nasty thing they could get in order to eat </s>
<s> they found out who they were and what they could do then within the limits of their talent they did it </s>
<s> and they traveled out of new york </s>
<s> only a native new yorker could believe that new york is now or ever was a literary center </s>
<s> it is a publishing and public relations center but these very facts prevent it from being a literary center because writers dislike provincialism and untruth </s>
<s> he displays what outlanders call the new york mind a state that the subject is necessarily unable to perceive in himself </s>
<s> the new york mind is two parts abstraction and one part misinformation about the rest of the country and in fact the world </s>
<s> we were also literary </s>
<s> the combination of the jewish intellectual tradition and the sensibility needed to be a writer created in my circle the most potent and incredible intellectual-literary ambition i have ever seen or could ever have imagined </s>
<s> within themselves just as people my friends were often tortured and unappeasably bitter about being the offspring of this unhappily unique-ingrown-screwedup breed </s>
<s> krim says in short that he is a suffering jew </s>
<s> the only possible answer to that is i am a suffering franco-irishman </s>
<s> we all love to suffer but some of us love to suffer more than others </s>
<s> had krim gone farther from new york than chapel hill he might have discovered that large numbers of american jews do not find his new york version of the jews lot remotely recognizable </s>
<s> this is not to deny the existence of pogroms and ghettos but only to assert that these horrors have had an effect on the nerves of people who did not experience them that among the various side effects is the local hysteria of jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from confusion which they call oppression and pain </s>
<s> in their stupidity and arrogance they believe they are called upon to remind the gentile continually of pogroms and ghettos </s>
<s> some of us have imagination and sensibility too </s>

<s> god knows that partisan and the rest often were and remain guilty of intellectual flatulence </s>
<s> sociological jargon germano-slavic approximations to english third-rate but modish fiction and outrages to common sense have often disfigured partisan and in lesser degree the other magazines on the list </s>

<s> little things </s>
<s> an italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around the area of quirinal palace the first time since the war </s>
<s> but who knew that might be coming one of these days </s>
<s> there were other italians who still bore scars they had earned in police station basements resisting </s>
<s> they laughed and true to national form and manners never talked long or solemnly on any subject at all but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts </s>
<s> we saw giuseppe berto at a party once in a while tall lean nervous and handsome and in our opinion the best novelist of them all except pavese and pavese is dead </s>
<s> now he was married to a beautiful girl had a small son and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the movies </s>
<s> on his desk was a slowly accumulating treatment and script of the count of monte cristo </s>
<s> so were a lot of other people </s>
<s> he was interested in italo svevo </s>
<s> he was thinking his way into a new novel a big one one that people had been waiting for </s>
<s> this one was going to be different </s>
<s> he had bought a little piece of property down along the coast of the hard country of calabria that he knew so well </s>
<s> he was going to do one or two more films for cash and then chuck it all leave rome and its intellectual cliques and money-fed life go back to calabria </s>
<s> berto seemed worried too </s>
<s> he knew all about it and had put it down in journal form in the war in a black shirt a wonderful book not for some strange reason published in the us </s>
<s> he knew all about the appeal of a black shirt and jackboots to a poor southern peasant boy </s>
<s> he knew all about the infection and the fever and too the moment of realization when he saw for himself threw up his hands and quit ended the war as a prisoner in texas </s>
<s> berto knew all about fascism </s>
<s> so did his friend the young novelist rimanelli </s>
<s> rimanelli is tough and square-built and adventurous says what he thinks </s>
<s> he had put it down in a war novel the day of the lion </s>
<s> these people were not talking much about it but you a foreigner sensed their apprehension and disappointment </s>
<s> so there we were talking around and about it </s>
<s> the english lady said she had to go to vienna for a while </s>
<s> it was a pity because she had planned to lay a wreath at the foot of the garibaldi statue towering over rome in spectacular benediction from the highpoint of the gianicolo </s>
<s> once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow lane </s>
<s> we had walked it many times and shivered figuring what a fish barrel it had been for the french </s>
<s> now the park is filled with marble busts and all the streets in the immediate area have the full and proper names of the men who fell </s>
<s> we were at a party once and heard an idealistic young european call that awful charge glorious </s>
<s> he said it was stupid butchery to order men to make a charge like that no matter who gave the order and what for </s>
<s> old world and new world </s>
<s> the sculptor looked at him bugeyed and amazed angry </s>

<s> when it was over eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded </s>
<s> the whole thing from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight rise of ground and then jumped off took maybe between twenty and thirty minutes </s>
<s> the sculptor looked at him let the color drain out of his face grinned and looked down into his drink a bad martini made with raw italian gin </s>
<s> there is a bronze wreath on the wall </s>
<s> like everything else in rome ruins and monuments alike that house is lived in </s>
<s> i have seen diapers strung across the ruined roof </s>
<s> she had her reasons for this </s>
<s> there were a few reasons for that too garibaldi had been taken up and exploited by the communists nowadays </s>
<s> therefore the government wanted no part of him </s>
<s> there was a new pope and the vatican was making itself heard and felt these days </s>
<s> as it happens the english lady is a good catholic herself but of more liberal political persuasion </s>
<s> all that the english lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument and lay a wreath at its base </s>
<s> this would show that somebody even a foreigner living in rome cared </s>
<s> and then there were other things </s>
<s> some of the marble busts in the park are of young englishmen who fought and died for garibaldi </s>
<s> she also mentioned leaving a little bunch of flowers at the bust of lauro di bosis </s>
<s> it is hard for me to know how i feel about lauro di bosis </s>
<s> i suffer from mixed feelings </s>
<s> he was a well-to-do handsome and sensitive young poet </s>
<s> his bust shows an intense mustached fine-featured face </s>
<s> he flew over rome one day during the early days of mussolini and scattered leaflets over the city denouncing the fascists </s>
<s> he was never heard of again </s>
<s> he is thought either to have been killed by the fascists as soon as he landed or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and crashing his plane </s>
<s> he was thus an early and spectacular victim </s>
<s> and there is something so wonderfully romantic about it all </s>
<s> he had crashed on takeoff once before </s>
<s> it was absurd and dramatic </s>
<s> it is remembered and has been commemorated by a bust in a park and a square in the city which was renamed piazzo lauro di bosis after the war </s>
<s> most romans even some postmen know it by the old name </s>
<s> faced with a gesture like di bosis i find usually that my sentiments are closer to those of my sculptor friend </s>
<s> the things that happened in police station basements were dirty grubby and most often anonymous </s>
<s> no poetry no airplanes no dancers </s>
<s> that is how the real routine of resistance goes on and its strength is directly proportionate to the number of insignificant people who can let themselves be taken to pieces piece by piece without quitting </s>
<s> it is an ugly business and there are few if any wreaths for them </s>
<s> i keep thinking of a young woman i knew during the occupation in austria </s>
<s> she was from prague </s>
<s> she had been picked up by the russians questioned in connection with some pamphlets sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage </s>
<s> she escaped crawled through the usual mine fields under barbed wire was shot at swam a river and we finally picked her up in linz </s>
<s> she showed us what had happened to her </s>
<s> no airplanes no nathan hale statements </s>
<s> i understand very well about lauro di bosis and how his action is symbolic </s>
<s> there was a pretty thorough silence at that point </s>
<s> my spoon stirring coffee banging against the side of the cup sounded as loud as a bell </s>
<s> i said i would do it for her </s>
<s> i had some reasons too </s>
<s> i admire the english lady </s>
<s> i hate embarrassing silences and have been known to make a fool out of myself just to prevent one </s>
<s> i also had and have feelings about garibaldi </s>
<s> and to top it all i am often sentimental on purpose trying to prove to myself that i am not afraid of sentiment </s>
<s> so much for all that </s>

<s> in most of the less developed countries however such programing is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent </s>
<s> only a very few of the more advanced ones such as india and pakistan have developed systematic techniques of programing </s>
<s> others have so-called development plans but some of these are little more than lists of projects collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them </s>
<s> only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation </s>
<s> we can help in the planning process </s>
<s> neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country </s>
<s> nevertheless we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing </s>
<s> first we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs </s>
<s> second we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program </s>
<s> surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy such as transport agriculture communication industry and power </s>
<s> designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation </s>
<s> and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established </s>
<s> we must use common sense in applying conditions </s>
<s> the application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds cannot of course be mechanical </s>
<s> it must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions </s>
<s> to insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth </s>
<s> in the more primitive areas where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available </s>
<s> thus we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs </s>
<s> d </s>
<s> encouraging self-help </s>
<s> the reasons for stressing self-help </s>
<s> a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help </s>
<s> there are many others </s>
<s> it is vitally important that the new us aid program should encourage all of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves </s>
<s> external aid can only be marginal although the margin as in the case of the marshall plan can be decisive </s>
<s> external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help </s>
<s> us aid therefore should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take </s>
<s> aid advice is not interference </s>
<s> in establishing conditions of self-help it is important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image </s>
<s> open societies can take many forms and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals </s>
<s> on the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them </s>
<s> the range of self-help </s>
<s> this includes not only development programing but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment </s>
<s> fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation </s>
<s> and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few </s>
<s> this includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports </s>
<s> it also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed </s>
<s> for both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country </s>
<s> otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability </s>
<s> in many societies what we regard as corruption favoritism and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly </s>
<s> yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources if dishonesty corruption and favoritism are widespread </s>
<s> moreover tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-american sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest </s>
<s> a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run but it is politically essential in the long run </s>
<s> us position on self-help </s>
<s> the united states can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained basis tailored to priority needs to those countries making serious efforts in self-help </s>
<s> in many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts </s>
<s> there are other countries where with skillful diplomacy we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth </s>
<s> governments are rarely monolithic </s>
<s> but there will be still other countries where despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help we shall deem it wise for political or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance </s>
<s> even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination </s>
<s> e </s>
<s> encouraging a long-term approach </s>
<s> development requires a long-term approach </s>
<s> the most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention our resources and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries </s>
<s> this is not a short-run goal </s>
<s> to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion </s>
<s> most of our aid will go to those nearing self-sufficiency </s>
<s> how long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country </s>
<s> in several significant cases such as india a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance </s>
<s> these cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance </s>
<s> gradually others will move up to the same level </s>
<s> the number of countries thus favorably situated is small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world </s>
<s> meantime over the decade of the sixties we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth </s>
<s> in still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible </s>
<s> aid is a long-term process </s>
<s> the whole program must be conceived of as an effort stretching over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world </s>
<s> it must be recognized as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in laos and cuba </s>
<s> it is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted </s>
<s> the specific reasons for a long-term approach </s>
<s> many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods </s>
<s> dams river development schemes transportation networks educational systems require years to construct </s>
<s> moreover on complex projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence </s>
<s> thus as a development program is being launched commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year </s>
<s> the capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same is true of country development programs </s>
<s> without such forward planning investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them </s>
<s> or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed </s>
<s> most important of all the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to allocate and commit their own resources </s>
<s> they must be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory policies </s>
<s> they must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section </s>
<s> the taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions </s>
<s> moreover once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves felt </s>
<s> they must therefore be related to long-range development plans </s>
<s> providing an incentive </s>
<s> if the less developed countries are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach the united states as the principal supplier of external aid must be prepared to give long-term commitments </s>
<s> in this as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones </s>
<s> the extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources to set targets toward which they should be working to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves all on a realistic long-term basis will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them </s>
<s> if they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required </s>
<s> perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with long-term commitments </s>

<s> it is notably significant that so many members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved speaker the honorable sam rayburn </s>

<s> remarks of hon wayne l hays of ohio </s>
<s> mr hays </s>
<s> it is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this paean of praise respect and affection for speaker sam rayburn </s>
<s> in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the stabilizing force that he represents in current american government is an almost indispensable source of strength </s>
<s> he has become in this half century the grand old man of american history </s>
<s> here briefly in this humble tribute i have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country </s>
<s> but the task is beyond me because i hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions sam rayburn has made as an individual as a legislator as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this nation </s>
<s> it happens that i am a legislator from ohio and that i feel deeply about the needs the aspirations the interests of my district and my state </s>
<s> for sam rayburn never forgot bonham his home community and he never forgot texas </s>
<s> in the same way i like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community our district our state </s>
<s> and if we follow the rayburn pattern as consciously or by an instinctual political sense i like to think i have followed it then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country </s>
<s> there is no such thing as being diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs </s>
<s> the two are as one </s>
<s> more than that sam rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition </s>
<s> through the most rancorous battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility </s>
<s> sam rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions </s>
<s> this means much to the american tradition </s>
<s> it is an answer in its way individual and highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics </s>
<s> and the name rayburn is one of the most dominant in the history of american politics for the last half century </s>
<s> it is i insist hard to define the rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes so deep </s>
<s> but this we know here is a great life that in every area of american politics gives the american people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor decency and self-respect </s>

<s> sam rayburn is one of the greatest american public figures in the history of our country and i consider that i have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing sam rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a member of the house of representatives in the congress of the united states </s>
<s> i prefer to speak however of sam rayburn the person rather than sam rayburn the american institution </s>
<s> although sam rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition </s>
<s> above all he is a person to whom a fledgling representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new congressman </s>
<s> in this role of father confessor he has always been most characteristic and most helpful </s>
<s> origin of state automobile practices </s>
<s> the practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years </s>
<s> the motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems records keeping analyses of vehicle use and effecting economies in vehicle operation </s>
<s> purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases </s>
<s> unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes </s>
<s> vehicle purchase assignment and use policies </s>
<s> the state purchases and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle </s>
<s> cars are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy </s>
<s> the factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances </s>
<s> unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles </s>
<s> it is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes </s>
<s> the state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars </s>
<s> automobile practices in other states </s>
<s> forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business </s>
<s> two other states provide vehicles but only with legislative approval </s>
<s> states which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency the individual or to a central pool </s>
<s> nineteen states report laws policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances </s>
<s> mileage allowances </s>
<s> fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis </s>
<s> actual mileage allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state </s>
<s> the travel regulations requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive </s>
<s> fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject </s>
<s> they have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment </s>
<s> however they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures </s>
<s> travel allowances </s>
<s> travel allowances including subsistence have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other states allowances </s>
<s> origin of state automobile practices </s>
<s> general background </s>
<s> it is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in rhode island </s>
<s> those that are available shed little light </s>
<s> it should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old </s>
<s> at that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties </s>
<s> using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable </s>
<s> once the principle was established the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly </s>
<s> and reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth </s>
<s> this rate of increase does not signify anything in itself </s>
<s> it does not indicate loose management ineffective controls or poor policy </s>
<s> but it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees </s>
<s> the fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them </s>
<s> history and operation of the motor pool </s>
<s> while the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly </s>
<s> this responsibility included all phases of management </s>
<s> it embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles who was to drive when and where repairs were to be made where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters </s>
<s> gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities </s>
<s> the state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual </s>
<s> the motor pool then as now had headquarter facilities in providence and other garages located throughout the state </s>
<s> under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made </s>
<s> the agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars </s>
<s> whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis </s>
<s> the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles </s>
<s> moreover it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet </s>
<s> the motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation </s>
<s> it contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work </s>
<s> where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses </s>
<s> pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be traded for sound economies </s>
<s> from this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data </s>
<s> one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities </s>
<s> present pool quarters at two locations in providence are crowded antiquated and in general make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment </s>
<s> good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more </s>
<s> purchasing practices </s>
<s> the purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state </s>
<s> requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made </s>
<s> bids are evaluated by the division of purchases with the assistance of pool staff and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders </s>
<s> unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public </s>
<s> in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier </s>
<s> this is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles </s>
<s> the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later </s>
<s> vehicle purchase assignment and use policies </s>
<s> probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles </s>
<s> the rhode island property tax </s>
<s> there was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well </s>
<s> for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax </s>
<s> since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years </s>
<s> at the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well </s>
<s> thus there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and in addition must give assistance to its local governments </s>
<s> this financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax or at least at the rates then existing insufficient for their requirements </s>
<s> consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level </s>
<s> notwithstanding state aid the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax </s>
<s> this is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored </s>
<s> problems of taxing personal property </s>
<s> these problems are not local to rhode island but are recognized as common to all states </s>
<s> situs of property </s>
<s> although the laws of the various states in general specify the situs of property ie residence or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exceptions regarding boats airplanes mobile homes etc seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment </s>
<s> rhode island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated </s>
<s> it also provides for the taxation of all personal property belonging to inhabitants of the state both tangible and intangible and the tangible personal property of non-residents in this state </s>
<s> intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year </s>
<s> both boats and aircraft would fall within this category as well as motor vehicles </s>
<s> the location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged </s>
<s> in view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft </s>
<s> this situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably justifiably </s>
<s> assessment of value </s>
<s> this problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem </s>
<s> this accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in rhode island </s>
<s> this condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted </s>
<s> the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the state take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property </s>
<s> an adequately staffed and equipped state assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the state </s>
<s> practices in rhode island </s>
<s> to determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in rhode island </s>
<s> the replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case </s>
<s> there are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town </s>
<s> these opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time </s>
<s> in reply to a question of whether they now tax boats airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not </s>
<s> the wording of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations </s>
<s> one assessor checked boats only another trailers and tractors one mentioned house trailers and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type </s>
<s> in two cases airplanes only were indicated </s>
<s> boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats </s>
<s> it would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property </s>
<s> so few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive </s>
<s> only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind </s>
<s> of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership </s>
<s> fifteen stated that it was according to location four by residence of the owner and nineteen did not answer </s>
<s> twenty-seven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property and only five were opposed </s>
<s> seven others expressed no opinion </s>
<s> on this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now </s>
<s> it is not clear however whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats trailers aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns </s>
<s> another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner </s>
<s> eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides </s>
<s> ten others made no reply </s>
<s> of those who have an opinion it seems that assessment by location is preferred </s>
<s> there was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date </s>
<s> to summarize it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge </s>
<s> the need for greater knowledge is evident from their replies </s>
<s> boats as personal property </s>
<s> taxing of boats </s>
<s> interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats </s>
<s> it has been obvious to the assessors particularly those in shore communities that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach </s>
<s> through their professional organization the rhode island tax officials association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed </s>
<s> no satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors </s>
<s> it has been estimated that the value of boats in rhode island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars excluding commercial boats </s>
<s> it is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation </s>
<s> however few are taxed and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations </s>
<s> no one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be </s>
<s> with minor exceptions this expansion was instituted either by firms based in rhode island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here </s>
<s> leading firms that arranged their own financing included speidel corporation cornell-dubilier photek inc division of textron narragansett gray iron foundry w r cobb company and mays manufacturing company </s>
<s> aids to small business </s>
<s> our office of foreign and domestic commerce carries on a vigorous program directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories </s>
<s> assistance is rendered to interested rhode island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations where to obtain specifications and follow-ups concerning qualification </s>
<s> how and where to apply for financial assistance </s>
<s> details on marketing </s>
<s> information concerning patents copyrights and trade marks availability of technical reports and other subjects of interest to small business </s>
<s> the office of foreign and domestic commerce is also active in the field of international trade assisting rhode island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad </s>
<s> this office cooperates with the u s department of commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include statistics on markets abroad </s>
<s> locating foreign agents buyers distributors etc </s>
<s> information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations licensing investments and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment </s>
<s> advertising program </s>
<s> we also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of rhode island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here </s>
<s> in addition to the regular schedule advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the new york times boston herald american banker electronic news and for local promotion the providence sunday journal </s>
<s> magazine advertising included management methods the new englander u s investor and plant location </s>
<s> new york led in the number of inquiries followed by california new jersey massachusetts and pennsylvania </s>
<s> among foreign countries responding were germany canada brazil and india </s>
<s> industrial promotion </s>
<s> these consist of visits without previous announcement on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas </s>
<s> industrial conferences </s>
<s> morning sessions included addresses by ward miller jr of the u s dept of commerce </s>
<s> richard preston executive director of the new hampshire state planning and development commission and edwin c kepler of general electric company </s>
<s> workshop sessions in the afternoon featured development executives from pennsylvania connecticut and maine and rounded out a rewarding program </s>
<s> devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in rhode island it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this division </s>

<s> additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for operation turnkey the new automated post office and a conference with representatives of brown university providence college and university of rhode island and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel </s>
<s> planning division </s>
<s> stated in its simplest terms the main job of the planning division is to plan for the future of the state of rhode island </s>
<s> the activities of the planning division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the development council which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning </s>
<s> as the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in this report plus an analysis of our own enabling act the planning division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a reorientation of its work program </s>
<s> these objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the planning division </s>
<s> first priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state </s>
<s> it will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government </s>
<s> to this end the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available on a shared cost basis technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff </s>
<s> the planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government </s>
<s> among the operating departments of the state </s>
<s> between the cities and towns of the state </s>
<s> and on a regional basis between the six new england states </s>
<s> the state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan </s>
<s> in preparing the state guide plan particular attention will be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation </s>
<s> functionally the planning division carries out four activities long-range state planning current state planning local planning assistance </s>
<s> and the preparation of the state development budget </s>
<s> long-range state planning </s>
<s> the planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation </s>
<s> the long-range aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases basic mapping inventory analysis and plan and policy formation </s>
<s> the work program as it was originally proposed was to take five years to complete </s>
<s> basic mapping </s>
<s> with these maps completed the inventory phase of the plan has been started </s>
<s> inventory </s>
<s> this phase consists of four items urban land use rural land use physical features and public utility service areas </s>
<s> since the validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible </s>
<s> the urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning </s>
<s> the rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the university of rhode island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use </s>
<s> analysis </s>
<s> the collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose </s>
<s> special districts in rhode island </s>
<s> it is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in rhode island </s>
<s> however a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government </s>
<s> these forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes to borrow money own property sue and be sued and in general to exercise normal corporate powers </s>
<s> unlike cities and towns however they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state bureau of audits </s>
<s> it is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government </s>
<s> fiscal years in other states </s>
<s> comparative data </s>
<s> a review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report </s>
<s> the remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state city and local governments </s>
<s> however only illinois oregon louisiana and rhode island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity </s>
<s> fiscal uniformity advantages and disadvantages </s>
<s> advantages </s>
<s> an excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently </s>
<s> the uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spending </s>
<s> the uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn </s>
<s> it enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts </s>
<s> the uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures </s>
<s> by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set on expenditures </s>
<s> the uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes </s>
<s> the uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures </s>
<s> when towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons </s>
<s> and as the cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also increases </s>
<s> towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare </s>
<s> of all advantages probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes </s>
<s> borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times </s>
<s> it may be by bank loans sale of notes or warrants or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants </s>
<s> in any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary </s>
<s> its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs heavy when short-term money rates are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most </s>
<s> this type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year </s>
<s> any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security </s>
<s> it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year </s>
<s> both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below </s>
<s> it has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap </s>
<s> but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important functions this is no longer true </s>
<s> the haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships </s>
<s> disadvantages </s>
<s> although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in rhode island there are also certain difficulties encountered </s>
<s> these involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle </s>
<s> one problem is a matter of shifting dates </s>
<s> the other is how to finance the transition </s>
<s> little can be done about the changing of dates </s>
<s> this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars </s>
<s> it usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time </s>
<s> but cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem </s>
<s> the other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns </s>
<s> this will be covered more fully later </s>
<s> it should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city </s>
<s> fortunately there are no cities or towns in the state with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change </s>
<s> adjusting the fiscal calendars </s>
<s> the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for rhode island municipalities to exert effort to secure them </s>
<s> the type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed </s>
<s> two features are immediately evident </s>
<s> first the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula </s>
<s> there are at least two problems to consider one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar </s>
<s> the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary </s>
<s> the latter matter is considered in detail in a later section </s>
<s> what is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them </s>
<s> an analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought </s>
<s> however it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved </s>
<s> no adjustment needed </s>
<s> no change is required for these towns </s>
<s> these municipalities include barrington lincoln middletown newport north kingstown and south kingstown </s>
<s> adjustment of fiscal year </s>
<s> one town and one city coventry and east providence require an adjustment of their fiscal year only </s>
<s> this change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year </s>
<s> adjustment of tax collection year </s>
<s> these cities and towns include bristol glocester pawtucket cumberland central falls and woonsocket </s>
<s> simultaneous adjustments </s>
<s> two cities to be considered providence and cranston are an enigma </s>
<s> both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars </s>
<s> the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them </s>
<s> under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods </s>
<s> varying adjustments </s>
<s> all of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years </s>
<s> methods of financing adjustments </s>
<s> aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary </s>
<s> it should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements </s>
<s> in many communities there is simply no financial problem </s>
<s> it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques </s>
<s> in other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes </s>
<s> fortunately such cases in rhode island are more the exception than the rule </s>
<s> in addition no two rhode island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition </s>
<s> these factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible </s>
<s> each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars the financial condition of the treasuries and the length of the transition interval </s>
<s> suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds </s>
<s> the financial problem where it exists usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period </s>
<s> for those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the problem </s>

<s> the american registry of pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the armed forces institute of pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international basis under such conditions as may be agreed upon between the national research council and the surgeons general of the army navy and air force </s>
<s> the staff utilized the collected material in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international meetings exhibits and published studies </s>
<s> these were selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational purposes </s>
<s> in this same period six new fascicles of the atlas of tumor pathology were published and distributed to medical centers world-wide </s>
<s> the clinico-pathologic conferences have been acknowledged as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated military hospitals </s>
<s> the demand for teaching sets continues unabated since they provide the means for the military physicians to review the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes </s>
<s> the medical museum </s>
<s> eighty-five specimens were loaned for study purposes </s>
<s> space was provided for short-time guest medical exhibits and the museum collected new accessions of microscopes medical surgical and diagnostic instruments uniform and similar items of historical medico-military significance </s>

<s> thirty-five military and civilian students received laboratory training </s>
<s> throughout the period and during the movement operation the museum continued its functional support of the armed forces institute of pathology </s>
<s> armed forces medical publication agency </s>
<s> its supplement the medical technicians bulletin supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel </s>
<s> in addition their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated air force medical bulletin </s>
<s> additionally on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations the availability of the journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage </s>
<s> each journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest and departments devoted to military medical news reviews of new books and other features of interest to officers of the medical services </s>
<s> this resulted in an improved appearance but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds </s>
<s> another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile </s>
<s> similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride </s>
<s> the development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion </s>
<s> this agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals </s>
<s> the method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter </s>
<s> the element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy </s>
<s> this is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element </s>
<s> a high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion </s>
<s> the shutter consists of two parts a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part </s>
<s> the opening action is obtained when a capacitor charged to high voltage is suddenly discharged through the foil </s>
<s> during the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line thus allowing light to pass into the camera </s>
<s> the shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil </s>
<s> laboratory measurements of interstellar radio spectra </s>
<s> the detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and perhaps planetary atmospheres </s>
<s> among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides oh and ch </s>
<s> somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides sh sih and aj </s>
<s> very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable </s>
<s> high sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver </s>
<s> therefore only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible </s>
<s> to secure precise measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started </s>
<s> since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead </s>
<s> this involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity </s>
<s> the first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the oh radical </s>
<s> results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which oh may be identified in interstellar gas </s>
<s> success in observing these spectral lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory </s>
<s> extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported </s>
<s> preparations are being made for similar experiments on ch and sh radicals </s>

<s> this result is preliminary and work is continuing </s>
<s> resistance thermometers </s>
<s> carbon resistors and impurity-doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region </s>
<s> vapor pressure method </s>
<s> a hydrostatic head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium </s>
<s> this has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer </s>
<s> in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow </s>
<s> pressure transducer for pvt measurements </s>
<s> precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer </s>
<s> a prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested </s>
<s> spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit </s>
<s> transport properties of air </s>
<s> this project was carried out under sponsorship of the ballistic missile division of the air research and development command us air force and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding </s>
<s> a significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region </s>
<s> another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present </s>
<s> international cooperative activities </s>
<s> as a first step toward this goal arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory </s>
<s> such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the aj </s>
<s> these thermometers have now been sent to the united kingdom for calibration at the national physical laboratory </s>

<s> transition probabilities </s>
<s> under the sponsorship of the office of naval research and the advanced research projects agency a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities </s>
<s> selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation </s>
<s> a wall-stabilized high-current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen </s>
<s> this apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements </s>
<s> a study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about af percent </s>
<s> studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities </s>
<s> these data are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas </s>

<s> mr speaker for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have </s>
<s> and the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied ranging all the way from government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service </s>
<s> there have been a number of sound plans proposed </s>
<s> but none of these has been implemented </s>
<s> instead we have stood idly by watched our commuter railroad service decline and have failed to offer a helping hand </s>
<s> nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the new york city area </s>
<s> not only is this kind of duplication wasteful but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the new york central and other railroads serving the area </s>

<s> the central has pointed out </s>
<s> detailed studies of the plan were well underway </s>
<s> though far from completion these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned their investors their customers their users and to the public at large </s>

<s> mr speaker in my latest newsletter to my constituents i urged the imposition of a naval blockade of cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued soviet armaments from coming into the western hemisphere in violation of the monroe doctrine </s>
<s> cuban ssr whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the castro-held mainland last week there was at least one positive benefit and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russian-dominated military base </s>
<s> in fact one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which cuba has been getting this russian military equipment </s>
<s> russian tanks and planes in cuba jeopardize the security of the united states violate the monroe doctrine and threaten the security of every other latin american republic </s>
<s> once the full extent of this russian military penetration of cuba was clear president kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this even if we had to go it alone </s>
<s> but the latin american republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing cuba off the inter-american defense board </s>
<s> there is a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week </s>
<s> you can see it for example in the extensive efforts president kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both cuba and laos </s>
<s> efforts as i see it which are being directed by the way toward support for future actions not for those already past </s>
<s> what the next move will be only time of course will tell </s>
<s> personally i think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of cuba </s>
<s> blockade is one answer offered by experts </s>
<s> in it they see a way to isolate cuba stop infiltration maybe finish castro too </s>
<s> weaken castro </s>
<s> blockade in the view of military and civilian experts could restore teeth to the monroe doctrine </s>
<s> it could halt a flood of communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching castro </s>
<s> it could stop cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to south america </s>
<s> it would be the most severe reprisal short of declared war that the united states could invoke against castro </s>
<s> it is the strategy of blockade therefore that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials members of congress officers in the pentagon </s>
<s> as a possible course of action it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions </s>
<s> land-based radar would help with this task </s>
<s> so would radar picket ships </s>
<s> a squadron of navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces </s>
<s> three requirements go with a blockade it must be proclaimed </s>
<s> the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it </s>
<s> and it must be enforced without discrimination </s>
<s> once these conditions of international law are met countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk </s>
<s> they could be sent to us ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated </s>
<s> plenty say the experts </s>
<s> in a broad sense it would reaffirm the monroe doctrine by opposing communist interference in the western hemisphere </s>
<s> it could by avoiding direct intervention provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration </s>
<s> primary target would be shipments of tanks guns aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from russia and czechoslovakia </s>
<s> shipments of arms from western countries could similarly be seized as contraband </s>
<s> in a total blockade action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals oils textiles and even foodstuffs </s>
<s> at times three ships a day from the soviet bloc are unloading in cuban ports </s>

<s> concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards </s>
<s> the roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together </s>
<s> work on the roof continues in this way </s>
<s> the last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter </s>
<s> when the roof blocks are all in place the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position </s>
<s> the structure is complete </s>
<s> solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and dense are used for this shelter </s>
<s> these blocks are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit </s>
<s> solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection </s>
<s> bricks are an alternative </s>
<s> more detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and craftsmen </s>
<s> aboveground double-wall shelter </s>
<s> an outdoor aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete blocks </s>
<s> this shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface making it impractical to build an underground shelter </s>
<s> the space between them is filled with pit-run gravel or earth </s>
<s> the walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built </s>
<s> an alternate roof perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams overlaid with boards and waterproofing </s>
<s> contractors charges would be additional </s>
<s> the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection </s>
<s> pre-shaped metal shelter </s>
<s> pre-shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground </s>
<s> these are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface </s>
<s> a contractor probably would be required to help build it </s>
<s> his charges would be added to the cost of materials </s>
<s> the national lumber manufacturers association washington d c is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction </s>
<s> the structural clay products institute washington dc is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction </s>
<s> underground concrete shelter </s>
<s> the shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection </s>
<s> the same shelter could be built into an embankment or below ground level </s>
<s> another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction </s>
<s> arrangement of the entrance </s>
<s> ventilation </s>
<s> radio reception </s>
<s> lighting </s>
<s> the entrance must have at least one right-angle turn </s>
<s> radiation scatters somewhat like light </s>
<s> some will go around a corner </s>
<s> the rest continues in a straight line </s>
<s> therefore sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter </s>
<s> ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance </s>
<s> a blower may be installed to increase comfort </s>
<s> a blower is essential for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters </s>
<s> radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation </s>
<s> as soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made </s>
<s> it probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive conelrad broadcasts </s>
<s> lighting is an important consideration </s>
<s> a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed </s>
<s> there should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas </s>
<s> other considerations </s>
<s> other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens </s>
<s> bunks or materials to build them may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed </s>
<s> the basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection </s>
<s> living in a shelter </s>
<s> the radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first </s>
<s> but the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous </s>
<s> therefore civil defense instructions received over conelrad or by other means should be followed </s>
<s> a battery-powered radio is essential </s>
<s> radiation instruments suitable for home use are available and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation </s>
<s> there is a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters may become available </s>
<s> one instrument thus would serve both purposes </s>
<s> your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from state and federal sources </s>

<s> families with children will have particular problems </s>
<s> they should provide for simple recreation </s>
<s> there should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated </s>
<s> part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake </s>
<s> to break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy </s>
<s> records such as diaries can be kept </s>
<s> the survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio </s>
<s> a record should be kept of the information and instructions including the time and date of broadcast </s>
<s> family rationing probably will be necessary </s>
<s> blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule </s>
<s> there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement </s>
<s> however as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum </s>
<s> the housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied </s>
<s> food medical supplies utensils and equipment if not already stored in the shelter must be quickly gathered up and carried into it </s>
<s> after the family has settled in the shelter the housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult in charge </s>
<s> sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning </s>
<s> provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem </s>
<s> a covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet </s>
<s> water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully </s>
<s> a portable electric heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates </s>
<s> it would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning </s>
<s> even if the electric power fails after an attack any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable </s>
<s> body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature </s>
<s> warm clothing and bedding of course are essential </s>
<s> open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided </s>
<s> a flame would use up air </s>
<s> some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need </s>
<s> if an attack finds you without a prepared shelter </s>
<s> few areas if any are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about </s>
<s> a family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation </s>
<s> on the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside </s>
<s> the best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house </s>

<s> shelter in apartment buildings </s>
<s> large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings </s>

<s> this however did not bar finding that du pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to general motors </s>
<s> that general motors share of the market for these products was substantial </s>
<s> the conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition </s>
<s> on the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion the court remanded the case to the district court to determine the appropriate relief </s>

<s> the submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract </s>
<s> the court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out </s>
<s> du pont christiana and delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over general motors </s>
<s> du pont christiana and delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with general motors and vice versa </s>
<s> and general motors and du pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by general motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du pont manufactured product or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by general motors to du pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of general motors or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies </s>

<s> under its plan du pont would retain its general motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares </s>
<s> christiana and delaware would in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the general motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders </s>
<s> du pont would be enjoined from having as a director officer or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of general motors and no director officer or employee of du pont could serve as a director of general motors without court approval </s>
<s> du pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional general motors stock except through general motors distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders </s>
<s> it argued inter alia that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both general motors and du pont with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions </s>
<s> that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies </s>
<s> that the tremendous volume of general motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of general motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital </s>

<s> i dissent </s>
<s> held on the record in this case the administrative procedures prescribed by the act were fully complied with </s>
<s> petitioner was not denied due process </s>
<s> and his conviction is sustained </s>
<s> petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings because the statement in question was in his file to which he had access and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the department of justice and before the appeal board </s>
<s> petitioner was not entitled either in the administrative hearing at the department of justice or at his trial to inspect the original report of the federal bureau of investigation since he was furnished a resume of it did not challenge its accuracy and showed no particular need for the original report </s>
<s> haydn c covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner </s>
<s> daniel m friedman argued the cause for the united states </s>
<s> on the brief were solicitor general rankin assistant attorney general wilkey beatrice rosenberg and j f bishop </s>
<s> mr justice clark delivered the opinion of the court </s>
<s> petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector contends that he was denied due process both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the department of justice and at trial </s>
<s> the trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents </s>
<s> the court of appeals affirmed </s>
<s> we granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the act </s>
<s> there followed a customary department of justice hearing at which petitioner appeared </s>
<s> in his report to the attorney general the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service </s>
<s> the appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation </s>
<s> upon return of the file to the local board petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so </s>
<s> but the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file </s>
<s> he admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer </s>
<s> this he failed to do asserting that he did not know it to be in his file </s>
<s> apparently he never took the trouble to find out </s>
<s> nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board </s>
<s> after the recommendation of the department is forwarded to the appeal board that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial </s>
<s> this he did </s>
<s> we found in gonzales v united states supra that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant </s>
<s> but there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult </s>
<s> petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original federal bureau of investigation reports to the department of justice </s>
<s> he alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld </s>
<s> nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of investigation reports might disclose </s>
<s> gonzales v united states supra </s>
<s> it is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of which the attorney general receives many and to which he may give his approval or rejection </s>
<s> it is but part of the whole process within the department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board </s>
<s> hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the department on file with the board </s>
<s> having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed </s>
<s> in addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes </s>
<s> moreover his testimony at trial never developed any such facts </s>
<s> finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the fbi report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial </s>
<s> even now no such claim is asserted </s>
<s> he bases his present contention on the general right to explore indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume </s>
<s> but this is fully answered by united states v nugent supra </s>
<s> even if we were not bound by nugent petitioner here would not be entitled to the report </s>
<s> foreign policy in its total context </s>
<s> with this enlarged role in mind i should like to make a few suggestions what we in the united states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world </s>
<s> we in this department must think about foreign policy in its total context </s>
<s> we cannot regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted </s>
<s> foreign policy is the total involvement of the american people with peoples and governments abroad </s>
<s> that means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must think in terms of the total context of our situation </s>
<s> assistant secretaries of state will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies </s>
<s> means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy </s>
<s> i think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action </s>
<s> every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer </s>
<s> unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present </s>
<s> the movement of events is so fast the pace so severe that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present </s>
<s> if there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs </s>
<s> action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control </s>
<s> there will of course be times for delay and inaction </s>
<s> what i am suggesting is that when we delay or when we fail to act we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties </s>
<s> we want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the department </s>
<s> we want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top </s>
<s> i hope no one expects that only presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas </s>
<s> the responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the department who has a policy function regardless of rank </s>
<s> further i would hope that we could pay attention to little things </s>
<s> while observing the operations of our government in various parts of the world i have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort </s>
<s> to cite only a few examples the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior position abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy </s>
<s> the attitudes of a un delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in new york city or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our capital can easily be directed against the united states and all that it stands for </s>
<s> dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world </s>
<s> sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them </s>
<s> i would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them </s>
<s> if the department of state is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas </s>
<s> this does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational interested responsible fashion </s>
<s> he is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country </s>
<s> he is expected to supervise to encourage to direct to assist in any way he can </s>
<s> if any official operation abroad begins to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action </s>
<s> the problems of a policy officer </s>
<s> it occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which i expressed privately in recent years in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside government </s>
<s> i tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces </s>
<s> this means practically everybody in this room </s>
<s> whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine </s>
<s> the senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli an idea in his own head the suggestions of a colleague a question from the secretary or the president a proposal by another department a communication from a foreign government or an american ambassador abroad the filing of an item for the agenda of the united nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies a news item read at the breakfast table a question to the president or the secretary at a news conference a speech by a senator or congressman an article in a periodical a resolution from a national organization a request for assistance from some private american interests abroad et cetera ad infinitum </s>
<s> the policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility </s>
<s> meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can never be complete and the general background much of which has already been lost to history </s>
<s> he is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policy-oriented conclusions </s>
<s> he knows that he must give the expert his place but he knows that he must also keep him in it </s>
<s> he is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action including doing nothing </s>
<s> he knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog </s>
<s> but he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy well-established precedents the commitments of the united states under international charters and treaties basic statutes and well-understood notions of the american people about how we are to conduct ourselves in policy literature such as country papers and national security council papers accumulated in the department </s>
<s> he will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted </s>
<s> he must think about which of these principles must take precedence </s>
<s> he will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance </s>
<s> he is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem </s>
<s> he must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer </s>
<s> the selection of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself </s>
<s> for if so the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem </s>
<s> respect for the opinions of mankind </s>
<s> for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it </s>
<s> he is interested in public opinion for two reasons first because it is important in itself and second because he knows that the american public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind </s>
<s> we do not want policy officers below the level of presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action </s>
<s> in the first place our business is foreign policy and it is the business of the presidential leadership and his appointees in the department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem </s>
<s> this is an important consideration </s>
<s> if we sit here reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports that cross our desks we should realize that this is raw undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership </s>
<s> what the american people will do turns in large degree on their leadership </s>
<s> we cannot test public opinion until the president and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action </s>
<s> and the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels </s>
<s> while there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women </s>
<s> the peace corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family unless the wife is also accepted for full-time peace corps work on the same project </s>
<s> there should be no draft exemption because of peace corps service </s>
<s> in most cases service in the corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment </s>
<s> peace corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the united states </s>
<s> nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid </s>
<s> the guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services </s>
<s> rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance </s>
<s> peace corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living </s>
<s> they should live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption </s>
<s> wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts </s>
<s> some special health requirements might have to be met </s>
<s> for example it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers </s>
<s> perhaps existing public health service state department and armed services medical facilities can be utilized </s>
<s> for readjustment to the us volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service based on the length of time served </s>
<s> the idea of a peace corps has captured the imagination of a great many people </s>
<s> support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines </s>
<s> for this the peace corps should be administered by a small new alive agency operating as one component in our whole overseas operation </s>
<s> pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program the peace corps should be established as an agency in the department of state </s>
<s> when the aid operations are reorganized the peace corps should remain a semi-autonomous functional unit </s>
<s> in this way the peace corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for united states foreign policy and our overseas operations </s>
<s> nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses </s>
<s> if launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks the peace corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall </s>
<s> within a year or two several thousand might be in service </s>
<s> it can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated </s>
<s> in the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects </s>
<s> the need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest </s>
<s> although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to receive it from the united states will vary from country to country </s>
<s> a certain skepticism about the coming of americans is to be expected in many quarters </s>
<s> unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility </s>
<s> but there are indications that many developing nations will welcome peace corps volunteers and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends </s>
<s> it is important however that the peace corps be advanced not as an arm of the cold war but as a contribution to the world community </s>
<s> in presenting it to other governments and to the united nations we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the united nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee </s>
<s> we should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands </s>
<s> in any case our peace corps personnel should be offered as technician helpers in development projects of the un and other international agencies </s>
<s> the peace corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership </s>
<s> our aim must be to learn as much as we teach </s>
<s> the peace corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the united states the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower </s>
<s> if presented in this spirit the response and the results will be immeasurably better </s>
<s> if it is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds in order to carry out the purposes of the mutual security act through this new peaceful program this will be a hopeful sign to the world </s>
<s> congress should then be asked to give the peace corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year </s>
<s> specifically congress should consider authorizing the peace corps to receive contributions from american businesses unions civic organizations and the public at large </s>
<s> for this must be the project of the whole american people </s>
<s> an advisory council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding </s>
<s> the extent to which participating bodies such as u s voluntary agencies universities international organizations and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the peace corps programs must be fully explored </s>
<s> no matter how well conceived and efficiently run there probably will be failures </s>
<s> these could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad </s>
<s> but as the popular response suggests the potentiality of the peace corps is very great </s>
<s> it can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions </s>
<s> it can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country </s>
<s> it can also contribute to the education of america and to more intelligent american participation in the world </s>
<s> with thousands of young americans going to work in developing areas millions of americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before </s>
<s> with colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program and with students looking toward peace corps service there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness </s>
<s> to the congress of the united states </s>
<s> i have today signed an executive order establishing a peace corps on a temporary pilot basis </s>
<s> the temporary peace corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization </s>
<s> in addition by starting the peace corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall </s>
<s> this temporary peace corps is being established under existing authority in the mutual security act and will be located in the department of state </s>
<s> its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program </s>
<s> throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires </s>
<s> our own freedom and the future of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity liberated from the bonds of hunger ignorance and poverty </s>
<s> this organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work </s>
<s> they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice </s>
<s> there is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them </s>
<s> wildlife habitat resources </s>
<s> the long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment </s>
<s> revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources </s>
<s> protection </s>
<s> the total adverse impact of disease insects fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized </s>
<s> they kill and destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage values and disrupt uses </s>
<s> these destructive forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows and upon the other renewable forest resources </s>
<s> the long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and high-level sustained yield of products and services </s>
<s> this can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations </s>
<s> in addition to direct protection measures more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease </s>
<s> protection from insects and disease </s>
<s> the initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated </s>
<s> the objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed </s>
<s> initiating a program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites </s>
<s> coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses </s>
<s> protection from fire </s>
<s> expansion modernization and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted standards </s>
<s> this is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort detection skilled fire-fighting crews and equipment use </s>
<s> this will include a stepped-up program of training and development of personnel </s>
<s> adoption and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention for suppression of fires while small and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely </s>
<s> reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas </s>
<s> protection from other damage </s>
<s> these areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the national forests </s>
<s> control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known </s>
<s> roads and trails </s>
<s> the transportation system which serves the national forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions </s>
<s> this system is divided into a forest highway system administered by the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system administered by the secretary of agriculture </s>
<s> both of these systems are essential for the production development and use of the national forests </s>
<s> these are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another </s>
<s> because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the secretary of commerce with maintenance provided by the states and counties this development program for the national forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed </s>
<s> these roads are largely of less than highway standards and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the national forests </s>
<s> construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture </s>
<s> the ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection </s>
<s> it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds </s>
<s> the protection of forage timber and wildlife resources from fire insects and disease </s>
<s> the balanced use of recreation hunting and fishing areas </s>
<s> the volume of timber that can be marketed especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises </s>
<s> the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire windstorm insects and disease </s>
<s> the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals </s>
<s> the existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes that is not otherwise possible </s>
<s> furthermore roads that give access to national forest timber are investments which pay their own way over a period of years </s>
<s> use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve </s>
<s> the long-range objective of this department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services </s>
<s> land adjustment land purchase land use </s>
<s> within the units in the national forest system the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular </s>
<s> in some units national forest ownership is well blocked together </s>
<s> in many others the previous patenting of land under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership </s>
<s> one consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring national forest or other federal land or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring national forest land </s>
<s> some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these federal lands </s>
<s> and some which are suitable for tree growing and for other national forest purposes are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation and are contributing nothing to the economy </s>
<s> there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed </s>
<s> lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the eastern states </s>
<s> the long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized national forest programs such as recreation development or which are a source of damage to lands in national forests and national grasslands </s>
<s> strategy and tactics of the us military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history </s>
<s> the change of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made with care mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other </s>
<s> our military forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war </s>
<s> forces and military personnel strength </s>
<s> if the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces </s>
<s> quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers </s>
<s> under modern conditions this is especially true of the ready reserve </s>
<s> i have requested the secretary of defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare </s>
<s> last year the congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the army reserve </s>
<s> i strongly recommend to the congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity </s>
<s> these strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives </s>
<s> military personnel costs </s>
<s> traditionally rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel </s>
<s> i endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates </s>
<s> operation and maintenance </s>
<s> the increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment </s>
<s> a substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential </s>
<s> further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the congress last year </s>
<s> in total these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the armed forces </s>
<s> this section prevents the military departments and the office of civil and defense mobilization from carrying out certain transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement with the committees on armed services of the senate and the house of representatives </s>
<s> as i have stated previously the attorney general has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles </s>
<s> accordingly if it is not repealed by the congress at its present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise </s>
<s> basic long-line communications in alaska are now provided through federal facilities operated by the army air force and federal aviation agency </s>
<s> the growing communications needs of this new state can best be met as they have in other states through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise </s>
<s> legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these government-owned systems in alaska and its early enactment is desirable </s>
<s> procurement research and construction </s>
<s> the decreases which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles guns and electronic devices </s>

<s> the task of providing a reasonable level of military strength without endangering other vital aspects of our security is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress </s>
<s> the last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history </s>
<s> some weapons systems have become obsolescent while still in production and some while still under development </s>
<s> furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon system in itself often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems </s>
<s> this has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events </s>

<s> notable in this category are the jupiter and thor intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed produced and deployed but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile </s>

<s> whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of the other </s>
<s> other factors playing a part in the extent of am service and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along the transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others </s>
<s> with the existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the commission to make assignments of am stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances </s>
<s> this is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere </s>
<s> all am stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals at all hours </s>
<s> but during the middle daytime hours these skywave radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are in general negligible </s>
<s> because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the am band with many more stations operating during the day than at night </s>
<s> however in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations representing an averaging of conditions and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions </s>
<s> it was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this purpose </s>
<s> these curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data </s>
<s> it was recognized that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength </s>
<s> allocation policies </s>
<s> as mentioned the allocation of am stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations </s>
<s> the rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the nation </s>
<s> to provide some service to all listeners </s>
<s> to provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible </s>
<s> to provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible </s>
<s> since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized and to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others </s>
<s> accordingly the commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations </s>
<s> the other objectives were subordinated to it </s>
<s> but nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course entails skywave interference to groundwave service interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it </s>
<s> as mentioned the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service free from destructive interference </s>
<s> during nighttime hours because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it </s>
<s> in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels </s>
<s> the history of the proceeding </s>
<s> since then there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena </s>

<s> introduction </s>
<s> it has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres </s>
<s> when sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials of the moon </s>
<s> observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface </s>
<s> radio observations of venus and jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets </s>
<s> this result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence </s>
<s> for the case of jupiter the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal components </s>
<s> of the remaining planets only mars and saturn have been observed as radio sources and not very much information is available </s>
<s> the low intensity of the radiation from saturn has limited observations but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin </s>
<s> no attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported and because of their distances small diameters or low temperatures the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity </s>
<s> in spite of this the very large radio reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years </s>
<s> they deduced from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion </s>
<s> piddington and minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves although opaque to infrared radiation </s>
<s> the infrared emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase </s>
<s> since the absorption of radio waves in rocklike material varies with wave length it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material </s>
<s> the observable characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity the polarization and the direction of arrival of the waves </s>
<s> this is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved </s>
<s> it should be possible however to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers </s>
<s> measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth </s>
<s> there have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation </s>
<s> other than this very significant result most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation </s>
<s> the concept of apparent black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets </s>
<s> the received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet </s>
<s> the apparent black-body disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation </s>
<s> the use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation and only if the planet really radiates as a black body will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material </s>
<s> the radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter wave lengths except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar radio noise </s>
<s> therefore neglecting the extreme outbursts reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length range </s>
<s> the moon </s>
<s> not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness distribution when reducing the data and this together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness temperatures </s>
<s> these observations indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions </s>
<s> mare imbrium seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which surround it </s>
<s> these contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude </s>
<s> such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted </s>
<s> the result of the observations is af where the phase angle q is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors </s>
<s> in the discussion which follows the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component </s>
<s> abstract </s>
<s> thus the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc </s>
<s> a detailed energy balance of the anode was established </s>
<s> the anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount </s>
<s> qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities </s>
<s> introduction </s>
<s> the high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation </s>
<s> the cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode </s>
<s> the higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs </s>
<s> in plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat </s>
<s> this energy transfer depends on the current the temperature in the arc column the anode material and the conditions in the anode sheath </s>
<s> heat transfer by molecular conduction as well as by radiation from the arc column </s>
<s> the heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up af </s>
<s> hence the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point </s>
<s> it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with those for the cathode </s>
<s> the gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions </s>
<s> however the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux </s>
<s> an attempt to improve the life of the anodes or the efficiency of the plasma generators must therefore aim at a reduction of the anode loss </s>
<s> the use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output </s>
<s> continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic forces </s>
<s> feedback of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode </s>
<s> the purpose of the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect of blowing on the arc voltage </s>
<s> a detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper </s>
<s> argon was used as a blowing gas to exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction </s>
<s> the anode material was porous graphite </s>
<s> sintered porous metals should be usable in principle </s>
<s> however technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots </s>
<s> the experimental arrangement as described below is based on the geometry of free burning arcs </s>
<s> experimental apparatus </s>
<s> this tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing </s>
<s> the transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially towards the cathode below </s>
<s> this small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode </s>
<s> a shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas </s>
<s> it was exposed to a high velocity gas jet </s>
<s> a plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts </s>
<s> this arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection </s>
<s> three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature </s>
<s> in this design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant </s>
<s> in addition the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation </s>
<s> temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug </s>
<s> the argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator </s>
<s> the power source was a commercial d c rectifier </s>
<s> the arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders </s>
<s> because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation </s>
<s> a high frequency starter was used to start the arc </s>
<s> experimental procedure and error analysis </s>
<s> transpiration cooled anode with carbon anode holder </s>
<s> the heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made </s>
<s> the argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between af and af </s>
<s> the lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable </s>
<s> this region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously </s>
<s> for each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured </s>
<s> to measure the surface temperature of the anode plug the surface was scanned with a pyrometer </s>
<s> as it turned out a very hot region occurred on the plug </s>
<s> its temperature was denoted by af </s>
<s> the size of this hot region was estimated by eye </s>
<s> the rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug </s>
<s> the mean temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug </s>
<s> it was denoted by af </s>
<s> the mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation af where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot </s>
<s> assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon the gas enthalpy rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation af whereby the specific heat of argon was taken as af </s>
<s> this calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures </s>
<s> they showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements </s>
<s> this temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned </s>
<s> it is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements </s>
<s> the reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry </s>
<s> the total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts </s>
<s> it was calculated from the temperature gradient af at af inch as af </s>
<s> the total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby af </s>
<s> it consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims </s>
<s> there is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed </s>
<s> a tape of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks </s>
<s> in normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks </s>
<s> after it has reached terminal velocity the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded </s>
<s> by the use of various weights data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtained </s>
<s> the instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described </s>
<s> this gives a rate of shear of af </s>
<s> this however can only be considered approximate as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs </s>
<s> although there were only four fluids tested it was apparent that there were two distinct types </s>
<s> two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure when undergoing shear and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two </s>
<s> a system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time </s>
<s> a back pressure was then introduced and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure </s>
<s> the actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand </s>
<s> these are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more newtonian because of their lower molecular weight </s>
<s> it is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus </s>
<s> this negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head af since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several magnitudes </s>
<s> these experiments can be considered exploratory only </s>
<s> however they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper </s>
<s> they also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures </s>
<s> such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies </s>
<s> the elasticity is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials </s>
<s> the actual change af caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head </s>
<s> if the volume is the molal volume then af is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists </s>
<s> although the af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects </s>
<s> af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h </s>
<s> the total volume of the system above the reference height is af and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of h </s>
<s> the minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to h and equating to zero </s>
<s> this gives af which is the pressure </s>
<s> this is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium </s>
<s> this method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields </s>
<s> the relation between osmotic pressure and the gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way </s>
<s> this can be justified thermodynamically in this case and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared </s>
<s> there is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar </s>
<s> if the mechanics are similar we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar </s>
<s> the concept of the strain energy as a gibbs function difference af and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear </s>
<s> from this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the af calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face </s>
<s> there is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids in shear fields </s>

<s> if they are not ellipsoids the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation </s>
<s> the direction of the tension of minimum pressure is of course given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids </s>
<s> these are reasonable assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear </s>
<s> this formula is given by rumscheidt and mason </s>
<s> if a is the major axis of an ellipsoid and b and c are the other two axes the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis af and the difference in pressure along the a and b axes is af </s>
<s> there are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas </s>
<s> this viscosity of the material in the drops is of course not negligible </s>
<s> measurements on the photograph in this paper give af at the maximum rate of shear of af </s>
<s> if it is assumed that the formula given by lodge of cosec af applies the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated </s>
<s> its value was af from the above data </s>

<s> it is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubber-like deformation </s>
<s> the internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume </s>
<s> in other words if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink </s>
<s> this means that work equals q which in turn equals af </s>
<s> this is known as conformational entropy </s>
<s> this conformational entropy is in this case equal to the usual entropy for there are no other changes or other energies involved </s>
<s> note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure </s>

<s> the paramagnetic dipole effects provide some information on the particle shapes </s>
<s> the nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei but the symmetry of the af bond in af remains in doubt </s>
<s> introduction </s>
<s> the magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei </s>
<s> it is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure </s>
<s> af appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters since it is a normal paramagnet with three unpaired electrons on the chromium its crystal structure is very simple and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong af bond provides structural interest </s>
<s> we first discuss the af bond in af </s>
<s> we then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment </s>
<s> indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects </s>
<s> the information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motional-modified models of the af bond in af </s>
<s> af bond in af </s>
<s> theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the af bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarities of packing in the solid </s>
<s> moreover it will be asymmetric until a certain critical af distance is reached below which it will become symmetric </s>
<s> there is ample evidence from many sources that the af bond in af is symmetric </s>
<s> there is evidence though less convincing than for af that the af bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric </s>
<s> douglass has studied the crystal structure of af by x-ray diffraction </s>
<s> he finds the structure contains an af bond with the af distance of af </s>
<s> there is then the possibility that this af bond is symmetric although douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his x-ray data </s>
<s> douglass found af to be trigonal laue symmetry af with af af </s>
<s> x-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of af </s>
<s> the x-ray data did not permit douglass to determine uniquely the space group but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry </s>
<s> under this assumption the space group must be af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell </s>
<s> af </s>
<s> this space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric </s>
<s> douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for af </s>
<s> these data lead to a structure in which sheets of cr atoms lie between two sheets of o atoms </s>
<s> the o atoms in each sheet are close packed and each cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of o atoms </s>
<s> the separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds </s>
<s> the gross details of the structure appear reasonable </s>
<s> the structure appears to be unique among ooh compounds but is the same as that assumed by af </s>
<s> the bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal </s>
<s> hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence </s>
<s> experimental procedures </s>
<s> samples </s>
<s> this material proved to be unsatisfactory since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample </s>
<s> subsequently we learned from douglass that his sample contained a few percent af impurity </s>
<s> since af is ferromagnetic we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated af would be suspect </s>
<s> plane suggested another preparation of af which we used here </s>
<s> this latter reaction is in accord with the reported decomposition of af </s>
<s> emission spectra indicated af calcium and all other impurities much lower </s>
<s> however af adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss </s>
<s> magnetic analyses by r g meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities </s>
<s> af was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electrons per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of af where af </s>
<s> an infrared spectrum obtained by h a benesi and r g snyder of this laboratory showed bands in the positions found by jones </s>
<s> the particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal domains are smaller than this </s>
<s> we found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron microscopic examination </s>
<s> the rf power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions by saturation effects </s>
<s> background spectra were obtained in all cases </s>
<s> the spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal </s>
<s> a single value of the thermal relaxation time af at room temperature was measured by the progressive saturation method </s>
<s> this measurement was obtained by w blumberg of the university of california berkeley by observing the breadth of the free induction decay signal </s>
<s> field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line defined as the field about which the first moment is zero </s>
<s> second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration </s>
<s> corrections were applied for modulation broadening apparatus background and field shift </s>
<s> for the low-temperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of andrew and eades </s>
<s> such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about af </s>
<s> the top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical </s>
<s> spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube </s>
<s> the bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary </s>
<s> this sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above </s>
<s> polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited </s>
<s> the market today for detergent builders is quite diverse </s>
<s> the best known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty spray-dried detergent formulations for household use </s>
<s> in the household market there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder </s>
<s> light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder </s>
<s> and the dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules none of which are now nationally advertised </s>
<s> the better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders </s>
<s> in addition many of the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis in trisodium orthophosphate which is still the major ingredient of a number of such products </s>
<s> many scouring powders now also contain phosphates </s>
<s> the cleaning process </s>
<s> cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces </s>
<s> wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium a solid substrate soil to be removed and the detergent or surface-active material </s>
<s> an oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved </s>
<s> one gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of af </s>
<s> even here there is room for some variation for metal surfaces vary in smoothness absorptive capacity and chemical reactivity </s>
<s> spring used a brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal depending upon surface roughness </s>
<s> there are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning </s>
<s> exclusive of esthetic values such as high- or low-foam level perfume content etc the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high </s>
<s> no matter how they are formulated a large number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application since they do not give adequate soil removal </s>
<s> this is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation </s>
<s> a good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings </s>
<s> since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents </s>
<s> harris has indicated that two devices the launder-ometer and terg-o-tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics </s>
<s> also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use </s>
<s> the soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash </s>
<s> soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones </s>
<s> as is the case with the surface-active agent the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high </s>
<s> large numbers of potential builders have been investigated but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice </s>
<s> the problems of hard-surface cleaning are not nearly as complex </s>
<s> in hard-surface cleaning the inorganic salts are more important than the organic active </s>
<s> indeed when the proper inorganic constituents are employed practically any wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation </s>
<s> hydroxides orthophosphates borates carbonates and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners </s>
<s> in addition the polyphosphates are also used probably acting more as peptizing agents than anything else </s>
<s> the importance of the inorganic constituents in hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers </s>
<s> physical chemistry of washing </s>
<s> although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces </s>
<s> dirt which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties </s>
<s> stains which include the wide variety of nonparticulate materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soiled object </s>
<s> miscellaneous soils which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue </s>
<s> the dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent </s>
<s> this is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles or to stick to an uncharged surface </s>
<s> obviously if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or if one kind is charged and the other kind is not the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced </s>
<s> likewise a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge </s>
<s> in addition dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids including liquid greases </s>
<s> greases stains and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface </s>
<s> in most cases these soils are taken up as liquids through capillary action </s>
<s> in an essentially static system an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent </s>
<s> the washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts to some extent as a dissolving and solvating agent </s>
<s> greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water </s>
<s> and natural waters in addition often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove </s>
<s> therefore detergents are used </s>
<s> the detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils </s>
<s> the other constituents in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils </s>
<s> as is well known detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution </s>
<s> physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants including the soaps have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration </s>
<s> micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately two-fold </s>
<s> although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process </s>
<s> in the cleaning process sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant </s>
<s> then during washing the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass with the aid of mechanical action and enter the aqueous phase </s>
<s> obviously a substance which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil </s>
<s> substances other than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases </s>
<s> this is particularly true of highly charged ions especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes </s>
<s> thus for aqueous media we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent </s>
<s> the charged particles then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions </s>
<s> the negatively charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase </s>
<s> this hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency </s>
<s> the crude picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as af </s>
<s> the influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale </s>
<s> freed soil must be dispersed and protected against flocculation </s>
<s> cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil </s>
<s> it is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe </s>
<s> and indeed there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active builder antiredeposition agent etc than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active </s>
<s> despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure reagents serious difficulty was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates of reaction </s>
<s> it appears possible to set a lower limit of about af for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form af radical </s>
<s> the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions </s>
<s> introduction </s>
<s> because of the simplicity of the molecules isotopic exchange reactions between elemental halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data </s>
<s> it would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond </s>
<s> the reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies </s>
<s> it should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid </s>
<s> it should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine </s>
<s> furthermore the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high </s>
<s> also it would be expected that af would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for af radicals </s>
<s> contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents </s>
<s> we are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride </s>
<s> experimental </s>
<s> reagents </s>
<s> of several methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine the exchange of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory </s>
<s> to prepare the latter silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing af obtained from the oak ridge national laboratory </s>
<s> the silver chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant product of af which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line </s>
<s> previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place </s>
<s> purified inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with a break seal </s>
<s> this chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distilled off </s>
<s> the required amount of carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line </s>
<s> the desired amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off </s>
<s> the contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking redistributed to the reaction tubes frozen down and each tube was then sealed off </s>
<s> the reactants for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off </s>
<s> this method in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of the six cells from a set </s>
<s> reaction conditions and analysis </s>
<s> these cells were used rather than square pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon tetrachloride </s>
<s> the round cells were reproducibly positioned in the light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window </s>
<s> the light was filtered by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell </s>
<s> relative incident light intensities were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system </s>
<s> changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell </s>
<s> after titration of the liberated af with af aliquots of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a solution-type geiger tube </s>
<s> in the liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments after emptying </s>
<s> results </s>
<s> the thermal reaction </s>
<s> following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes </s>
<s> in addition to the method described in the section above chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a af eutectic on the vacuum line and by exchange of af with molten af </s>
<s> calcium hydride was substituted for af as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride </s>
<s> no correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found </s>
<s> in most cases the chlorine concentration was about af </s>
<s> the liquid phase photochemical reaction </s>
<s> the liquid phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible than the thermal exchange although still erratic </s>
<s> the improvement was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold </s>
<s> rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings </s>
<s> in all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination </s>
<s> it was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine and considering the spectral distribution of the light source </s>
<s> exchange was also observed in these cells which had chlorine present at af </s>
<s> the photochemical exchange in the gas phase </s>
<s> further the corpuscular radiation ie the solar-wind protons must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size with a resultant increase in both the poynting-robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force </s>
<s> the poynting-robertson effect causes the semi-major axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun </s>
<s> also planetary gravitational attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is approached </s>
<s> if such is the case the particles within a distance of about af of the earth will have relative to the earth a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the earth </s>
<s> this effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the earth </s>
<s> since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects there must be a continual replenishment otherwise micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space </s>
<s> there are several possible sources </s>
<s> asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material </s>
<s> it is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon </s>
<s> one cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space </s>
<s> even in the neighborhood of the earth where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude </s>
<s> this large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved </s>
<s> at greater distances from the sun the situation is still less certain </s>
<s> there are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment </s>
<s> direct information has been obtained from rockets and satellites equipped with impact sensors </s>
<s> in addition the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain </s>
<s> from the brightness of the f component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light an estimate of the particle sizes concentrations and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane </s>
<s> another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component </s>
<s> the cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category </s>
<s> the data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth </s>
<s> these instruments are installed on rockets satellites and space probes </s>
<s> these vehicles with large sensitive areas have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure </s>
<s> many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products contribute some information </s>
<s> this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration and an assumed impact velocity of af </s>
<s> the data show daily and diurnal variations </s>
<s> for the next two days the impact rate was af </s>
<s> the data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux </s>
<s> the data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations </s>
<s> space probes have yielded little information </s>
<s> with detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts the second and third russian space probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones </s>
<s> being based on so few events these results are of dubious validity </s>
<s> the calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain </s>
<s> many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities </s>
<s> however one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear relationship </s>
<s> in the united states most of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces </s>
<s> the russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor </s>
<s> there is a difference in the experimental arrangement in that the us microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instruments are isolated from the skin </s>
<s> the threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of af in the us work and af in the ussr work </s>
<s> however the conversion from mass to size is unreliable since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as af </s>
<s> to what extent such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown </s>
<s> the velocity value used is also open to some question </s>
<s> if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the earth only about one third the above-mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass </s>
<s> zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors </s>
<s> the diurnal variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity </s>
<s> the flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data </s>
<s> the radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density af except for the smallest particles which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar-radiation pressure </s>
<s> the flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual meteors </s>
<s> the unshielded flux is given in the last column </s>
<s> these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the earth </s>
<s> of course if there is a dust blanket around the earth the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here </s>
<s> note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used </s>
<s> the older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light </s>
<s> extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites </s>
<s> the approximate equation is af where n is the number of af with electron line-density greater than or equal to af and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite </s>
<s> at the fifteenth magnitude af and at the twenty-fifth magnitude af </s>
<s> the extrapolation may be in error for several reasons </s>
<s> the observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region </s>
<s> the solar-electromagnetic- and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated poynting-robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns </s>
<s> indirect indications of micrometeorite flux </s>
<s> this is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx </s>
<s> present data indicate an accretion of about af tons per year over the entire globe or about af </s>
<s> biological warfare </s>
<s> biological warfare is the intentional use of living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man </s>
<s> it is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development resulting in the production of bw weapons systems </s>
<s> man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals </s>
<s> biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon </s>
<s> the major reason for this is that it has no quick-kill effect </s>
<s> the incubation period of infectious disease plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter </s>
<s> a man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious diseases </s>
<s> thus an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities </s>
<s> an important operational procedure in bw for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area </s>
<s> this concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of particulate biological materials the pathogenesis of respiratory infections the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence </s>
<s> the biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years </s>
<s> much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics </s>
<s> much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques </s>
<s> much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures </s>
<s> the intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure through natural respiration to aerosolized organisms </s>
<s> the importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated </s>
<s> the natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence </s>
<s> this area is highly susceptible to infection </s>
<s> the entrance and retention of infectious particles in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation </s>
<s> in considering bw defense it must be recognized that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect </s>
<s> for example bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air </s>
<s> there are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne </s>
<s> neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface </s>
<s> it will rise during lapse conditions </s>
<s> certain other properties of small particles in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract are noteworthy in defense considerations </s>
<s> the smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out </s>
<s> an aerosol of such small particles moreover diffuses through structures in much the same manner as a gas </s>
<s> there may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens restaurants food stores hospitals etc </s>
<s> depending on the organism there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products ie in milk for example </s>
<s> the secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense </s>
<s> something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials </s>
<s> in the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological conditions </s>
<s> this material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which facilitates its sampling and assessment </s>
<s> these dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case </s>
<s> the behavior of a biological aerosol on a much smaller scale is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism </s>
<s> an aqueous suspension of the spores of b subtilis var niger generally known as bacillus globigii was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles </s>
<s> the spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small naval vessel cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze </s>
<s> spraying continued along a two-mile course </s>
<s> a network of sampling stations had been set up on shore </s>
<s> these were located at the homes of government employees in government offices buildings and reservations within the trial area </s>
<s> a rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first ninth and fifteenth floors of a government office building </s>
<s> all samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one which was operated for four hours </s>
<s> this suggests that the sampling period particularly at the more distant locations should have been increased </s>
<s> it is quite likely that an even greater area was covered particularly downwind </s>
<s> the dosages in the three levels of the vertical profile were af </s>
<s> this was not of course enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol </s>
<s> a number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural portal of entry </s>
<s> some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle size than by the natural portal </s>
<s> botulinal toxin for example is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os </s>
<s> in some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure making diagnosis difficult </s>
<s> an enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious </s>
<s> agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing q fever tularemia brucellosis glanders coccidioidomycosis etc belong in this category </s>
<s> an agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements </s>
<s> it is obviously a proper goal of research to improve on this property </s>
<s> in this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction </s>
<s> moreover it should not be so fastidious in its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable </s>
<s> an aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population </s>
<s> a solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized </s>
<s> it must be remembered however that there are many agents for which there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent </s>
<s> there is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made </s>
<s> an enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality </s>
<s> it is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains </s>
<s> mutants may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification </s>
<s> all of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management </s>
<s> biological agents are of course highly host-specific </s>
<s> they do not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives </s>
<s> this may be of overriding importance in considering military objectives </s>
<s> the question of epidemic disease merits some discussion </s>
<s> only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem </s>
<s> some of those who question the value of bw have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics </s>
<s> they then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of epidemics it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated </s>
<s> this is why this approach to bw defense has not been given major attention </s>
<s> our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target </s>
<s> this of course does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease </s>
<s> a hypothetical example will illustrate this point </s>
<s> no epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in city a was not lousy </s>
<s> lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus </s>
<s> in this case then the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack </s>
<s> this was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic </s>
<s> on the other hand a similar attack might have been made on city b whose population was known to be lousy </s>
<s> one might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack </s>
<s> the major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate disseminating devices </s>
<s> it should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons </s>
<s> if it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city </s>
<s> biological agents are moreover suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense </s>
<s> a few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned </s>
<s> the air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack </s>
<s> america is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed precooked and even predigested foods </s>
<s> this is an enormous industry that is subject to sabotage </s>
<s> one must include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products </s>
<s> huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack </s>
<s> a variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies </s>
<s> modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators </s>
<s> abelson and rawson using a stepwise elution scheme fractionated whole sera containing abo and rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl deae cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose </s>
<s> speer and coworkers in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera used a series of gradients for elution from aj </s>
<s> in the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on deae-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by sober and peterson and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the abo and rh systems have been described </s>
<s> materials and methods </s>
<s> samples </s>
<s> serum samples were obtained from normal group a group b and group o donors </s>
<s> three of the anti-rh sera used were taken from recently sensitized individuals </s>
<s> these antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous af red cells </s>
<s> serological technique </s>
<s> anti-a and anti-b activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group a group b or group o donors by the following tube agglutination methods </s>
<s> in several instances group o cells were also used as controls </s>
<s> all samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods </s>
<s> the activities of fractions of sera containing rh antibodies were tested by the saline albumin and indirect coombs techniques </s>
<s> homozygous and heterozygous af cells af and homozygous and heterozygous af cells were used to test each sample </s>
<s> however in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous af and homozygous af cells will be presented here </s>
<s> the saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect coombs test in the following manner </s>
<s> the anti-human sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits </s>
<s> chromatography </s>
<s> after dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a af cm column of eeae-cellulose equilibrated with starting buffer </s>
<s> paper electrophoresis </s>
<s> because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure it was used in all but the earliest experiments </s>
<s> the unstained strips were then marked using the stained ones as a guide and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands </s>
<s> ultracentrifugation </s>
<s> sedimentation coefficients were computed as af values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the schlieren patterns </s>
<s> other methods will be described below </s>
<s> experimental and results </s>
<s> the insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity regardless of the blood group of the donor </s>
<s> not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating activity as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas </s>
<s> in all cases most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity </s>
<s> these fractions were tested for abo agglutinin activity using fractions from group ab plasma as a control </s>
<s> once again both anti-a and anti-b activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis </s>
<s> chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide </s>
<s> the incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram </s>
<s> the complete in the latter part </s>
<s> the insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity </s>
<s> this was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera </s>
<s> when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample no complete antibody activity could be detected </s>
<s> apart from the honeybee practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor </s>
<s> occasionally you may come across one or two bumblebees in the cold season when you are turning over sods in your garden but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all </s>
<s> they keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt </s>
<s> even some of the queens will die before the winter is over falling prey to enemies or disease </s>
<s> now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red ribes sanguineum of our pacific northwest or otherwise a good sloe tree or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom preferably one with male or staminate catkins </s>
<s> the blooms of ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble honeybees bumblebees and other wild bees and also various kinds of flies </s>
<s> it is a happy buzzing crowd </s>
<s> each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers </s>
<s> it is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always arranged in pairs and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green black-tipped little scale </s>
<s> by scrutinizing the flowers one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts </s>
<s> the staminate willow catkins then provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen </s>
<s> a marvelous arrangement for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed </s>
<s> the only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites </s>
<s> i will deal with these later on </s>
<s> quite often honeybees form a majority on the willow catkins </s>
<s> as we have already seen in the first chapter bumblebees are bigger hairier and much more colorful than honeybees exhibiting various combinations of black yellow white and orange </s>
<s> let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game and let us just call them bombus </s>
<s> there must be several dozen species in the united states alone </s>
<s> if you really insist on knowing their names an excellent book on the north american species is bumblebees and their ways by o e plath </s>
<s> if we manage to keep track of a bombus queen after she has left her feeding place we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep </s>
<s> as befits a queen a bumblebee female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable nesting place </s>
<s> most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such as a deserted mouse nest a bird house or the hole made by a woodpecker </s>
<s> some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss </s>
<s> she also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey </s>
<s> then a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed </s>
<s> the queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen taking a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots </s>
<s> when the larvae hatch they feed on the beebread although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother </s>
<s> she continues to add to the pollen supply as needed </s>
<s> the larvae kept warm by the queen are full grown in about ten days </s>
<s> each now makes a tough papery cocoon and pupates </s>
<s> after another two weeks the first young emerge four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying </s>
<s> the first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs </s>
<s> males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season </s>
<s> the broods of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones probably because they are better fed </s>
<s> simultaneously males or drones are produced mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers although a few may be produced by the queen </s>
<s> the young queens and drones leave the nest and mate and after a short period of freedom the fertilized young queens will begin to dig in for the winter </s>
<s> it is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing for instance in august </s>
<s> the temperature then is still very high </s>
<s> at the old nest the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females </s>
<s> not always though does the development of a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described </s>
<s> some members of the bee family have become idlers social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives </s>
<s> female individuals of psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize </s>
<s> the female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host </s>
<s> when she succeeds she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment </s>
<s> the hosts never seem to recognize that something is amiss so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally </s>
<s> thus the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread </s>
<s> later on they and the mother psithyrus are fed by the bombus workers </s>
<s> worse still in a number of cases it has been claimed that the psithyrus female kills the bombus queen </s>
<s> but let us return after this gruesome interlude to our willow catkins in the spring </s>
<s> there are other wild bees that command our attention </s>
<s> it is almost certain that some of these usually a trifle smaller than the honeybees are andrenas or mining bees </s>
<s> one of my favorites is a armata a species very common in england where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee </s>
<s> the females like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawns where their little mounds of earth often appear by the hundreds </s>
<s> almost equal in size to a honeybee a armata is much more beautiful in color at least in the female of the species a rich velvety rusty red </s>
<s> the males are much duller </s>
<s> after having mated an andrena female digs a hole straight down into the ground forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil </s>
<s> the development of the andrena larvae is very rapid so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults </s>
<s> but they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer fall and winter </s>
<s> their appearance next spring coincides in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants </s>
<s> this must be due to a completely identical response to the weather in the plant and the animal </s>
<s> after the male and female andrenas have mated the cycle is repeated </s>
<s> although andrena is gregarious so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together we must still call it a solitary bee </s>
<s> its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species </s>
<s> after all social life in the group of the bees is by no means general although it certainly is a striking feature </s>
<s> on the basis of its life history we like to think that andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees </s>
<s> the way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect either </s>
<s> it lacks pollen baskets and possesses only a large number of long branched hairs on its legs on which the pollen grains will collect </s>
<s> still andrena will do a reasonably good job so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind </s>
<s> closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees </s>
<s> nomia melanderi can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the united states west of the great plains for example in utah and central washington </s>
<s> often the burrows are only an inch or two apart and the bee cities cover several acres </s>
<s> the life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of andrena but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage </s>
<s> in most places there are two generations a year a second brood of adults appearing late in the summer </s>
<s> i must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias </s>
<s> this may just be pride in my adopted state of washington but certainly i love to visit their mound cities near yakima and prosser in july or august when the bees are in their most active period </s>
<s> sometimes although by no means always these are indeed alkaline </s>
<s> the thing is that these bees love a fine-grained soil that is moist </s>
<s> yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either </s>
<s> they dislike dense vegetation </s>
<s> the best chance of course is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth </s>
<s> it is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity </s>
<s> he was working with species of java so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect </s>
<s> certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions </s>
<s> additional records of slow growth have been omitted </s>
<s> it is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves </s>
<s> data on the former are scanty but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others thereby lending support to the belief that the anaconda does indeed attain the greatest length </s>
<s> let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda </s>
<s> the african rock python a close second is followed in turn by the reticulate python </s>
<s> there are few data on the boa constrictor those for the anaconda are unconvincing and there is nothing at all on the amethystine python </s>
<s> it seems likely that the indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently </s>
<s> it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep </s>
<s> i cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth </s>
<s> at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet </s>
<s> until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions </s>
<s> it is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity but this apparently is an overestimation </s>
<s> data on the boa constrictor about match this </s>
<s> another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity </s>
<s> results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations about three years are required there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required </s>
<s> only the amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data </s>
<s> oliver in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the united states could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition to the rattlers which i shall consider separately </s>
<s> klauber investigated the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found </s>
<s> he concluded that in the southern species which are rapidly growing types females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three </s>
<s> other herpetologists have ascertained that in the northern united states the prairie rattlesnake may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old and that the young may be born every other year rather than annually </s>
<s> maximum length </s>
<s> oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions </s>
<s> measurements of skins are of little value </s>
<s> every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer </s>
<s> in spite of all the pitfalls there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants </s>
<s> the anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment but the reason for this is not clear </s>
<s> the relatively wild conditions still found in tropical south america might be responsible </s>
<s> there are three levels on which to treat the subject </s>
<s> the first is the strictly scientific which demands concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh </s>
<s> this approach rejects virtually all field measurements </s>
<s> the next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced sensible conclusion </s>
<s> field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated </s>
<s> the third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire </s>
<s> the argument against this last approach is comparable to that which rejects stories about hoop snakes about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards </s>
<s> the mere piling up of testimony does not prove to the scientific mind the existence of hoop snakes joint snakes or ghosts </s>
<s> bernard heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes but on the third level and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda </s>
<s> his thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength but these seem to be given to complete his picture not to be believed </s>
<s> detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows </s>
<s> growth of the six giants </s>
<s> discussions of the giants one by one will include as far as possible data on these aspects of growth size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached </s>
<s> time required to reach maturity </s>
<s> rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage </s>
<s> definite information on the growth of senile individuals is lacking </s>
<s> anaconda </s>
<s> at birth this species varies considerably in size </s>
<s> the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the brookfield brood and its average </s>
<s> a difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size </s>
<s> it is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate </s>
<s> however as a field measurement it is open to question </s>
<s> it is possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to a small area </s>
<s> in snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of subspecies </s>
<s> boa constrictor </s>
<s> this birth length seems to be typical </s>
<s> when some thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are collated little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected </s>
<s> however as so many of the records are not certainly based on newborn snakes these data must be taken tentatively </s>
<s> final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods from definite localities </s>
<s> i have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity </s>
<s> what data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate </s>
<s> unfortunately no one has kept complete records of one individual whereas many have been made for a very short period of time </s>
<s> the results are too varied to allow generalization </s>
<s> the bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout </s>
<s> another marked difference is noted here </s>
<s> the bronchial artery except for a small number of short branches in the hilum contributes none of the pleural blood supply </s>
<s> no bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group </s>
<s> it is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules </s>
<s> air-drifts from one area to another are therefore conceivable </s>
<s> this relationship however is not maintained centrally </s>
<s> the bronchial artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals </s>
<s> this pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches </s>
<s> such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once </s>
<s> some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface </s>
<s> with completion of filling net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches </s>
<s> an unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted </s>
<s> this was accounted for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery </s>
<s> in distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery </s>
<s> also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted via the pleura </s>
<s> through the interlobular septa </s>
<s> discussion </s>
<s> it is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made </s>
<s> the significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined </s>
<s> however the dynamics of airflow from morphologic considerations alone may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse </s>
<s> the volume and perhaps even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse </s>
<s> also interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow </s>
<s> probably occur in the horse much as in the human being </s>
<s> a reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present </s>
<s> within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and if one is permitted to speculate potential pathology should be included in this statement as well </s>
<s> one might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse </s>
<s> in addition it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow considering its marked lobular development but conversely not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog </s>
<s> the only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries </s>
<s> the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear </s>
<s> however this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung </s>
<s> the alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues </s>
<s> therefore an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue not primarily diffusing in nature in the region of the alveolus </s>
<s> if this be true the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema </s>
<s> our own studies in which bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein and then by injecting the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards </s>
<s> it is distinctly possible therefore that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence uninjectable </s>
<s> in other words the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts </s>
<s> in addition little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses </s>
<s> the possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred </s>
<s> certainly the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species </s>
<s> it is however highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species especially the dog </s>
<s> in conclusion these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology pathology and histology of mammalian lungs </s>
<s> in addition a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent </s>
<s> also for the present great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man </s>
<s> this is especially so if the dog cat or monkey are to be used in view of their marked anatomical differences from man </s>
<s> finally it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species </s>
<s> summary </s>
<s> the main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented </s>
<s> a tabulation of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types </s>
<s> this may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present </s>
<s> the maturity chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence </s>
<s> third the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls a fact which confirms data for other groups of children </s>
<s> the onset profile and completion profile are constructed to serve as norms for children </s>
<s> the upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation </s>
<s> to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity chart each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers </s>
<s> first the upper portion requires series of films for every child consisting of those from hand elbow shoulder knee and foot </s>
<s> the lower portion necessitates only films of hand </s>
<s> second the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long short and round bones of the five regions </s>
<s> the lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly since only two long bones are included in hand and wrist as a region </s>
<s> third the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level onset and completion </s>
<s> the lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each hand center as well as their onset and completion </s>
<s> fourth the two indicators are for the most part widely separated chronologically with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center </s>
<s> the lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood </s>
<s> it may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body </s>
<s> accordingly maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart respectively should be somewhat similar since skeletal age assessments are dependent upon onsets during infancy and upon completions during adolescence </s>
<s> it is clear that there are some differences in the ratings but there is substantial agreement </s>
<s> since a skeletal age rating can be made at any age during growth from elbow shoulder knee or foot as well as hand it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood </s>
<s> such an indicator or indicators are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress </s>
<s> the differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows </s>
<s> the direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at completion from the level at onset </s>
<s> the length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at completion over that at onset and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables </s>
<s> for the boy this epiphysis was markedly delayed at onset but near the mean at completion </s>
<s> in contrast for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at onset and delayed at completion </s>
<s> obviously the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between onset and completion </s>
<s> its completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth dietary patterns and health during adolescence </s>
<s> the growth center depicted here in the distal phalanx of the second finger is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones </s>
<s> it is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group </s>
<s> thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys </s>
<s> his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean </s>
<s> b </s>
<s> organification of iodine </s>
<s> the precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood </s>
<s> however the formation of organically bound iodine mainly mono-iodotyrosine can be accomplished in cell-free systems </s>
<s> this iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems </s>
<s> in addition the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine </s>
<s> it is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue </s>
<s> on chemical grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to af and then to af as the active iodinating species </s>
<s> iodination of tyrosine however is not enough for the synthesis of hormone </s>
<s> the mono- and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine </s>
<s> there is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control </s>
<s> c </s>
<s> thyroglobulin synthesis </s>
<s> little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin </s>
<s> its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in vitro been unequivocally proven </s>
<s> similar findings have been noted in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzymes whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide </s>
<s> in addition depending on availability of dietary iodine thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine </s>

<s> antithyroid drugs </s>
<s> antithyroid drugs are of two general types </s>
<s> one type has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoro type </s>
<s> this ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid </s>
<s> it does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such </s>
<s> the other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil </s>
<s> these drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism but they inhibit organification </s>
<s> on the other hand there are a few antithyroid drugs of this same general type such as resorcinol possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine </s>
<s> any of the antithyroid drugs of either type if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre owing to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with production of hypothyroidism </s>
<s> the anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased output of tsh causing the thyroid to enlarge </s>
<s> the effect of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet </s>
<s> the antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type however are not antagonised by such means </s>
<s> besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol types certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods </s>
<s> it is presumed to occur in other members of the brassica family </s>
<s> there it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen which is then secreted in the milk </s>
<s> f </s>
<s> dietary influences </s>
<s> besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid gland </s>
<s> with lower levels thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine </s>
<s> further the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally </s>
<s> in the presence of a low iodine intake thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with af is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal the amounts of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced </s>
<s> this appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin </s>
<s> if the deficiency persists long enough it is reasonable to suppose that the af label will reflect the af distribution in the thyroglobulin </s>
<s> similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions that limit iodide trapping or organification or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis </s>

<s> the hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone </s>
<s> at the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism tsh acts on the thyroid but for bio-assay of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated including release of iodine from the thyroid increase in thyroid weight increase in mean height of the follicular cells and increase in the thyroidal uptake of af </s>

<s> since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man in addition by complex symbols one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex </s>
<s> in experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated </s>
<s> moreover the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions </s>
<s> a previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey a and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges </s>
<s> it seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity is concerned and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional responsiveness of the organism </s>
<s> but even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex </s>
<s> it should be added that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception memory imagination and creativity </s>
<s> previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response </s>
<s> the visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute to memory but this topic is beyond the scope of this paper </s>
<s> hypothalamic balance and its significance </s>
<s> after this brief discussion of neo- paleocortical and cortico-hypothalamic relations let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance </s>
<s> facilitatory processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways </s>
<s> thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive discharges </s>
<s> on the other hand the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored </s>
<s> apparently a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex </s>
<s> consequently if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level the lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges </s>
<s> obviously a vicious cycle develops </s>
<s> this tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways </s>
<s> it is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism </s>
<s> before we comment further on these pathological conditions we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness </s>
<s> thus a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness resulting in synchronous eeg potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition </s>
<s> with the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus the opposite changes occur </s>
<s> since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus </s>
<s> similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals </s>
<s> of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect </s>
<s> although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance </s>
<s> the former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs the latter the tranquilizers </s>
<s> specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as for instance between reserpine and chlorpromazine </s>
<s> important as these differences are they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side we produce depressions whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and eventually maniclike changes </s>
<s> the emotional states produced by drugs influence the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner </s>
<s> synchrony prevails in the eeg of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive drugs </s>
<s> the shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance </s>
<s> physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges </s>
<s> they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side </s>
<s> this explains the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the mecholyl test </s>
<s> some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the mecholyl test and conversely between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm </s>
<s> nevertheless the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients </s>
<s> the mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions additional tests seem to be desirable </s>
<s> it was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle </s>
<s> a change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal individual to sleep or in special circumstances to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting </s>
<s> in both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished but no depression occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs </s>
<s> perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to qualitative alterations in reactivity </s>
<s> if for instance such a change is produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks previously inhibited conditioned reactions reappear </s>
<s> however if these procedures are applied more often conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished </s>
<s> these are few and seemingly disjointed data but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation pharmacological action or clinical processes </s>
<s> on the physiological basis of some form of psychotherapy </s>
<s> the foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion </s>
<s> if this is the case one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise </s>
<s> this phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses </s>
<s> being a strictly physiological procedure one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself </s>
<s> an important observation of pavlov served as a guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means </s>
<s> in a conditioning experiment he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain </s>
<s> a mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding </s>
<s> even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually it failed to evoke any signs of pain </s>
<s> since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding </s>
<s> appropriate experiments showed that this is indeed possible </s>
<s> he then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses </s>
<s> he took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established </s>
<s> for the interpretation of these significant investigations it should be remembered that reciprocal relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions which are closely associated with the emotions </s>
<s> the feeding-pain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho- and ergotropic systems </s>
<s> furthermore a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety </s>
<s> although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present different autonomic-somatic patterns underlie aggression and anxiety respectively as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines the state of the muscle tone and the mecholyl test </s>
<s> the psychological incompatibility of these emotional states seems to be reflected in or based on this marked difference </s>
<s> concluding remarks </s>
<s> in our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems respectively </s>
<s> we stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding the hypothalamic-cortical discharge </s>
<s> although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems as a first approximation it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances in experimental and clinical neurosis and as the result of psychopharmacological agents </s>
<s> in view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes </s>
<s> the primary decomposition theorem </s>
<s> we are trying to study a linear operator t on the finite-dimensional space v by decomposing t into a direct sum of operators which are in some sense elementary </s>
<s> if we try to study t using characteristic values we are confronted with two problems </s>
<s> first t may not have a single characteristic value </s>
<s> this is really a deficiency in the scalar field namely that it is not algebraically closed </s>
<s> this is clearly a deficiency in t </s>
<s> thus t is not diagonalizable </s>
<s> on the other hand the null space of af and the null space of af together span v the former being the subspace spanned by af and the latter the subspace spanned by af and af </s>
<s> this will be more or less our general method for the second problem </s>
<s> the diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which af for each i </s>
<s> the theorem which we prove is more general than what we have described since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial whether or not the primes which enter are all of first degree </s>
<s> let t be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space v over the field f </s>
<s> let p be the minimal polynomial for t af where the af are distinct irreducible monic polynomials over f and the af are positive integers </s>
<s> let af be the null space of af </s>
<s> proof </s>
<s> the idea of the proof is this </s>
<s> the projection af will be the identity on af and zero on the other af </s>
<s> we shall find a polynomial af such that af is the identity on af and is zero on the other af and so that af etc </s>
<s> for each i let af </s>
<s> thus there are polynomials af such that af </s>
<s> note also that if af then af is divisible by the polynomial p because af contains each af as a factor </s>
<s> we shall show that the polynomials af behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of the proof </s>
<s> let af </s>
<s> since af and p divides af for af we have af </s>
<s> thus the af are projections which correspond to some direct-sum decomposition of the space v </s>
<s> we wish to show that the range of af is exactly the subspace af </s>
<s> if af then af is divisible by af and so af ie af </s>
<s> it is certainly clear that the subspaces af are invariant under t </s>
<s> this shows that the minimal polynomial for af divides af </s>
<s> conversely let g be any polynomial such that af </s>
<s> then af </s>
<s> thus af is divisible by the minimal polynomial p of t ie af divides af </s>
<s> it is easily seen that af divides g </s>
<s> hence the minimal polynomial for af is af </s>
<s> corollary </s>
<s> if af are the projections associated with the primary decomposition of t then each af is a polynomial in t and accordingly if a linear operator u commutes with t then u commutes with each of the af ie each subspace af is invariant under u </s>
<s> now the range of af is the null space af of af </s>
<s> let us put af </s>
<s> let us look at the operator af </s>
<s> now af af so af </s>
<s> the reader should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that af and in general that af </s>
<s> definition </s>
<s> let n be a linear operator on the vector space v </s>
<s> we say that n is nilpotent if there is some positive integer r such that af </s>
<s> let t be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space v over the field f </s>
<s> suppose that the minimal polynomial for t decomposes over f into a product of linear polynomials </s>
<s> proof </s>
<s> we have just observed that we can write af where d is diagonalizable and n is nilpotent and where d and n not only commute but are polynomials in t </s>
<s> now suppose that we also have af where d is diagonalizable n is nilpotent and af </s>
<s> we shall prove that af </s>
<s> since d and n commute with one another and af we see that d and n commute with t </s>
<s> thus d and n commute with any polynomial in t </s>
<s> hence they commute with d and with n </s>
<s> now we have af or af and all four of these operators commute with one another </s>
<s> since d and d are both diagonalizable and they commute they are simultaneously diagonalizable and af is diagonalizable </s>
<s> since n and n are both nilpotent and they commute the operator af is nilpotent </s>
<s> if we take af above that will be large enough </s>
<s> it then follows that af is large enough but this is not obvious from the above expression </s>
<s> such an operator is obviously the zero operator </s>
<s> for since it is nilpotent the minimal polynomial for this operator is of the form af for some af </s>
<s> but then since the operator is diagonalizable the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root </s>
<s> thus we see that af and af </s>
<s> corollary </s>
<s> let v be a finite-dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field f eg the field of complex numbers </s>
<s> then every linear operator t in v can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator d and a nilpotent operator n which commute </s>
<s> these operators d and n are unique and each is a polynomial in t </s>
<s> from these results one sees that the study of linear operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study of nilpotent operators </s>
<s> for vector spaces over non-algebraically closed fields we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors </s>
<s> it is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter </s>
<s> in concluding this section we should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of the primary decomposition theorem </s>
<s> we have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus is not purely linear algebra </s>
<s> let n be a positive integer and let v be the space of all n times continuously differentiable functions f on the real line which satisfy the differential equation af where af are some fixed constants </s>
<s> if af denotes the space of n times continuously differentiable functions then the space v of solutions of this differential equation is a subspace of af </s>
<s> let us now regard d as a linear operator on the subspace v </s>
<s> then af </s>
<s> if we are discussing differentiable complex-valued functions then af and v are complex vector spaces and af may be any complex numbers </s>
<s> we now write af where af are distinct complex numbers </s>
<s> in other words if f satisfies the differential equation af then f is uniquely expressible in the form af where af satisfies the differential equation af </s>
<s> thus the study of the solutions to the equation af is reduced to the study of the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form af </s>
<s> this reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear algebra ie by the primary decomposition theorem </s>
<s> to describe the space of solutions to af one must know something about differential equations </s>
<s> that is one must know something about d other than the fact that it is a linear operator </s>
<s> however one does not need to know very much </s>
<s> it is very easy to establish by induction on r that if f is in af then af </s>
<s> that is af etc </s>
<s> thus af if and only if af </s>
<s> a function g such that af ie af must be a polynomial function of degree af or less af </s>
<s> thus f satisfies af if and only if f has the form af </s>
<s> accordingly the functions af span the space of solutions of af </s>
<s> since af are linearly independent functions and the exponential function has no zeros these r functions af form a basis for the space of solutions </s>
<s> examples of binomial experiments </s>
<s> some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials each with two possible outcomes </s>
<s> the binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another </s>

<s> student football managers </s>

<s> each friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck </s>
<s> on three fridays the coach has needed a driver </s>
<s> discussion </s>
<s> each trial consists of choosing a student manager at random </s>
<s> since the choice is by lot each week the outcomes of different trials are independent </s>
<s> the managers stay the same so that af is the same for all weeks </s>
<s> we now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments </s>
<s> below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties </s>
<s> we also give for each property an example where the property is absent </s>
<s> the language and notation introduced are standard throughout the chapter </s>
<s> there must be a fixed number n of repeated trials </s>
<s> experiment without a fixed number of trials </s>
<s> toss a die until an ace appears </s>
<s> here the number of trials is a random variable not a fixed number </s>
<s> binomial trials </s>
<s> each of the n trials is either a success or a failure </s>
<s> experiment without the two-class property </s>
<s> we can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the animal as not constituting a trial but such a solution is not always satisfactory </s>
<s> all trials have identical probabilities of success </s>
<s> each die has probability af of producing an ace </s>
<s> note that we need not know the value of p for the experiment to be binomial </s>
<s> experiment where p is not constant </s>
<s> the trials are independent </s>
<s> strictly speaking this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials </s>
<s> thus in the three-dice example af af and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace not-ace ace in that order is af </s>
<s> experimentally we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another </s>
<s> examples where independence fails </s>
<s> a family of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains and a coin is tossed to decide </s>
<s> we want to know the number of people going to the mountains </s>
<s> when this experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials one for each member of the family the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent </s>
<s> indeed the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family </s>
<s> the following is a less extreme example of dependence </s>
<s> consider couples visiting an art museum </s>
<s> each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize </s>
<s> an experiment consists of the voting of one couple or two trials </s>
<s> in repetitions of the experiment from couple to couple the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors </s>
<s> we want to study the probability function of this random variable </s>
<s> a binomial experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes </s>
<s> the constancy of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in practice </s>
<s> obviously very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference </s>
<s> that is we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its departures from the binomial model </s>
<s> to summarize </s>
<s> a binomial experiment consists of af independent binomial trials all with the same probability af of yielding a success </s>
<s> the outcome of the experiment is x successes </s>
<s> the random variable x takes the values af with probabilities af or more briefly af </s>
<s> we shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x successes for given values of p and n </s>
<s> when each number of successes x is paired with its probability of occurrence af the set of pairs af is a probability function called a binomial distribution </s>
<s> random variables </s>
<s> the several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable x the total number of successes which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials </s>
<s> their sum is x the total number of successes which in this experiment has the value af </s>
<s> consider a simple closed plane curve c which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle and which is given by af </s>
<s> these are real analytic periodic functions with period t </s>
<s> in the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares </s>
<s> this theorem is similar to the theorem of kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed bounded convex set in af </s>
<s> the latter theorem has been generalized by yamabe and yujobo and cairns to show that in af there are families of such cubes </s>
<s> here for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results </s>
<s> a square inscribed in a curve c means a square with its four corner points on the curve though it may not lie entirely in the interior of c </s>
<s> indeed the spiral af with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square </s>
<s> the square has one corner point on the straight line segment and does not lie entirely in the interior </s>
<s> on c from the point p at af to the point q at af we construct the chord and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as s approaches zero the square is inside c </s>
<s> as s increases we consider the two free corner points of the square af and af adjacent to p and q respectively </s>
<s> as s approaches t the square will be outside c and therefore both af and af must cross c an odd number of times as s varies from zero to t </s>
<s> the points may also touch c without crossing </s>
<s> suppose af crosses c when af </s>
<s> we now have certain squares with three corners on c </s>
<s> for any such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the diagonal point of the square </s>
<s> each point on c as a vertex may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal points by the above construction </s>
<s> to each paired vertex and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point ie the corner on c reached first by proceeding along c from the vertex in the direction of increasing t </s>
<s> the set of intersections of af the rotated curve with the original curve c consists of just the set of forward corner points on c corresponding to the vertex at af plus the vertex itself </s>
<s> we note that two such curves c and af cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points </s>
<s> otherwise being analytic they would coincide at all points which is impossible since they do not coincide near af </s>
<s> with each vertex we associate certain numerical values namely the set of positive differences in the parameter t between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points </s>
<s> for the vertex at af these values will be denoted by af </s>
<s> we will refer to the plane of c and af as the c-plane and to the plane of the graph as the aj </s>
<s> the graph as a set may have a finite number of components </s>
<s> each point with abscissa t on the graph represents an intersection between c and af </s>
<s> there are two types of such intersections depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection </s>
<s> an ordinary point will be any point of intersection a such that in every neighborhood of a in the c-plane af meets both the interior and the exterior of c </s>
<s> any other point of intersection between c and af will be called a tangent point </s>
<s> this terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the aj </s>
<s> we can now prove several lemmas </s>
<s> in some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph the function f is a single-valued continuous function </s>
<s> proof </s>
<s> we first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood </s>
<s> with the vertex at af in the c-plane we assume that af is the parametric location on c of an ordinary intersection q between c and af </s>
<s> in the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are af </s>
<s> we know that in the c-plane both c and af are analytic </s>
<s> in the c-plane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian coordinates u v with the origin at q and such that both c and af have finite slope at q </s>
<s> near q both curves can be represented by analytic functions of u </s>
<s> in a neighborhood of q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued analytic function of u </s>
<s> furthermore one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference function is monotone for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of extrema in any interval </s>
<s> now to find af one needs the intersection of c and af near q </s>
<s> the arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve </s>
<s> thus if e is sufficiently small there can be only one intersection of c and af near q for if there were more than one intersection for every e then the difference between c and af near q would not be a monotone function </s>
<s> therefore af is single-valued near q </s>
<s> it is also seen that af since the change from af to af is accomplished by a continuous translation </s>
<s> thus af is also continuous at af and in a neighborhood of af which does not contain a tangent point </s>
<s> we turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph </s>
<s> this set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals </s>
<s> this prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points </s>
<s> in some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane say af the function af is either double-valued or has no values defined except at the tangent point itself where it is single-valued </s>
<s> proof </s>
<s> a tangent point q in the c-plane occurs when c and af are tangent to one another </s>
<s> a continuous change in t through an amount e results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve af </s>
<s> in the second category the function af has no values defined in a neighborhood af </s>
<s> in the third category the function is double-valued in this interval </s>
<s> the same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of af </s>
<s> again the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist </s>
<s> in the neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two-valued or no-valued on one side and is a single-valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side </s>
<s> with the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of f </s>
<s> definition </s>
<s> the graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval aj </s>
<s> proof </s>
<s> we suppose not </s>
<s> then every component of the graph of f must be defined over a bounded sub-interval </s>
<s> suppose af is defined in the sub-interval af </s>
<s> now af and af must both be tangent points on the t component in the f-plane </s>
<s> thus the multiplicity of af for a given t must be an even number </s>
<s> this is true of all components which have such a bounded support </s>
<s> there must be an odd number of such components which will be called complete components </s>
<s> we must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the c-plane are on opposite sides of c </s>
<s> we again consider a fixed point p at af and a variable point q at af on c </s>
<s> we erect a square with pq as a side and with free corners af and af adjacent to p and q respectively </s>
<s> as s varies from zero to t the values of s for which af and af cross c will be denoted by af and af respectively </s>
<s> we have af plus tangent points </s>
<s> these s-values are just the ordinary values of af </s>
<s> proof </s>
<s> the functions f and b have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument t </s>
<s> now with p fixed at af af-values occur when the corner af crosses c and are among the values of s such that af </s>
<s> introduction </s>
<s> these are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol af </s>
<s> no generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible </s>
<s> a general line l meets q in two points af and af through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus af whose lines are simple secants of aj </s>
<s> on these generators let af and af be respectively the harmonic conjugates of af and af with respect to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets aj </s>
<s> the line af is the image of l </s>
<s> clearly the transformation is involutorial </s>
<s> we observe first that no line l can meet its image except at one of its intersections with q </s>
<s> for if it did the plane of l and l would contain two generators of af which is impossible </s>
<s> moreover from the definitive transformation of intercepts on the generators of af it is clear that the only points of q at which a line can meet its image are the points of aj </s>
<s> hence the totality of singular lines is the t order complex of lines which meet aj </s>
<s> since the complex of singular lines is of order k and since there is no complex of invariant lines it follows from the formula af that the order of the involution is af </s>
<s> there are various sets of exceptional lines or lines whose images are not unique </s>
<s> the most obvious of these is the quadratic complex of tangents to q each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to q at the image of the point of tangency of the given line </s>
<s> thus pencils of tangents to q are transformed into pencils of tangents </s>
<s> in particular tangents to c are transformed into tangents to c </s>
<s> moreover if af and af are two planes intersecting in a line l tangent to q at a point p the two free intersections of the image curves af and af must coincide at p the image of p and at this point af and af must have a common tangent l </s>
<s> the congruence of its secants is therefore of order af and class af </s>
<s> a final class of exceptional lines is identifiable from the following considerations since no two generators of af can intersect it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections </s>
<s> in other words these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all </s>
<s> since two curves of symbol af on q intersect in af points it follows that there are af lines of af which are tangent to aj </s>
<s> hence its image c meets any line of af in af points </s>
<s> moreover c obviously meets any line af in a single point </s>
<s> hence c is a af curve on q </s>
<s> therefore the congruence of its secants that is the image of a general plane field of lines is of order af and class af </s>
<s> finally the image of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant lines namely af and whose class is the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines namely af </s>
<s> we now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described </s>
<s> to see this consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of aj </s>
<s> on c there is a af correspondence in which the af points cut from c by a general line l of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection of the image of l and the plane of the pencil </s>
<s> since c is rational this correspondence has k coincidences each of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image </s>
<s> from the preceding remarks it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion </s>
<s> hence it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective de jonquieres involution of order af and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either af or af </s>
<s> in each case lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant </s>
<s> the multiple secants of course are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order af </s>
<s> observations similar to these can be made at each point of aj </s>
<s> moreover if af no two of the multiple secants can intersect </s>
<s> however if there is no additional complex of singular lines the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely af </s>
<s> now consider an arbitrary line l meeting q in two points af and af </s>
<s> these societies can expect to face difficult times </s>
<s> as the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces the gaps between rulers and subjects town and country will widen </s>
<s> new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence </s>
<s> old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction </s>
<s> nevertheless with foresight and careful planning some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped </s>
<s> the united states can help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible </s>
<s> our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face </s>
<s> at the same time we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts </s>
<s> it may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable tasks at home </s>
<s> we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene </s>
<s> when necessary we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development </s>
<s> as a nation we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development </s>
<s> but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world community </s>
<s> transitional societies </s>
<s> when we look at countries like iran iraq pakistan and burma where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital and where institutions of centralized government exist we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy </s>
<s> the men in power are committed in principle to modernization but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically </s>
<s> isolated enterprises have been launched but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern </s>
<s> the society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector with very poor communications between the two </s>
<s> progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources human and material can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically accepted </s>
<s> most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective </s>
<s> in these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals </s>
<s> for example in accordance with the fashion of the times most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years </s>
<s> such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement </s>
<s> the civil services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them </s>
<s> and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice self-discipline and competence </s>
<s> american policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies </s>
<s> we should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call for effort as well as enthusiasm </s>
<s> above all we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible for their fates </s>
<s> only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance </s>
<s> with respect to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their illusions we can afford to wait for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see </s>
<s> our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments </s>
<s> we should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities state and provincial governments rural communities and other smaller groups making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected </s>
<s> simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships of technical progress in various fields showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education how health affects labor productivity how small business can benefit the rural farm community and above all how progress in each field relates to national progress </s>
<s> efforts such as the community development program in the philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development </s>
<s> to achieve this goal of balanced development communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken into account </s>
<s> if modernization programs are imposed from above without the understanding and cooperation of the people they will encounter grave difficulties </s>
<s> land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries </s>
<s> it should be american policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society </s>
<s> as an isolated policy land reform is likely to be politically disruptive </s>
<s> as part of a larger development effort however it may gain wide acceptance </s>
<s> it should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone </s>
<s> land reform programs need to be supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance in agriculture </s>
<s> lastly governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead </s>
<s> by holding out prospects for external capital assistance the united states can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth </s>
<s> actively modernizing societies </s>
<s> at a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as india brazil the philippines and taiwan which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining growth </s>
<s> they must continue to satisfy basic capital needs </s>
<s> and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups </s>
<s> but these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital </s>
<s> they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels </s>
<s> and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies </s>
<s> on the economic front the first priority of these countries is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources </s>
<s> several related tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved </s>
<s> these countries must formulate a comprehensive long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy </s>
<s> they must in their planning be able to count on at least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years </s>
<s> capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go forward </s>
<s> capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning </s>
<s> finally a balance must be effected among project finance utilization of agricultural surpluses and general balance of payments support </s>
<s> thus although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant the basic purpose of american economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange </s>
<s> there remain many political and administrative problems to be solved </s>
<s> for one thing although considerable numbers of men have been trained bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects </s>
<s> even the famed indian civil service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken </s>
<s> technical assistance in training middle- and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases </s>
<s> there are also more basic problems </s>
<s> this is the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people </s>
<s> nevertheless impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices </s>
<s> another great danger is that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism </s>
<s> the capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the west </s>
<s> particularly when based upon a single dominant party governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest </s>
<s> convinced of the wisdom of their own actions and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort becoming instead more rigid and inflexible in their policies </s>
<s> american policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes </s>
<s> it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies </s>
<s> we have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries </s>
<s> we also have in consequence the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways </s>
<s> the time factor </s>
<s> we have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period of time </s>
<s> with the exception of treaty-making foreign relations were historically concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration </s>
<s> foreign policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection </s>
<s> american and free-world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition </s>
<s> but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes political institutions and social structure which each society must generate </s>
<s> it follows that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working horizon </s>
<s> it must be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its trademark </s>
<s> this condition affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy especially in the context of economic aid </s>
<s> some of the major functions of religion </s>
<s> the place of religion in the simple preliterate societies is quite definite </s>
<s> as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it </s>
<s> in societies like ours however its place is less clear and more complex </s>
<s> with the diversity of religious viewpoints there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion </s>
<s> and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion </s>
<s> nevertheless for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies though less for the less religious portion religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions </s>
<s> although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization they have important indirect consequences </s>
<s> if the inner functions of religion are performed the individual is a composed ordered motivated and emotionally secure associate </s>
<s> he is not greatly frustrated and he is not anomic </s>
<s> he is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows </s>
<s> there are several closely related inner functions </s>
<s> man is first religious </s>
<s> the instrumentalities follow </s>
<s> religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence </s>
<s> the significant things in it at the higher religious levels are the inner emotional mental and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs of self-preservation self-pacification and self-completion </s>
<s> the chief experience is the sensing of communion and in the higher religions of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power </s>
<s> related to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered dependable universe </s>
<s> man has the experience of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand </s>
<s> he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement </s>
<s> the universe is a safe and permanent home </s>
<s> a number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal </s>
<s> death is not permanent defeat and disappearance </s>
<s> man has a second chance </s>
<s> he is not lost in the abyss of endless time </s>
<s> he has endless being </s>
<s> religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm of the spirit </s>
<s> there is also the possibility among higher religions of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and expansiveness </s>
<s> the kind of religious experience that most moderns seek not only provides clarifies and relates human yearnings values ideals and purposes </s>
<s> it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality sociality and creativeness </s>
<s> under the religious impulse whether theistic or humanistic men have joy in living </s>
<s> life leads somewhere </s>
<s> at the same time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment it also has great therapeutic value for him </s>
<s> it gives him aid comfort even solace in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate </s>
<s> he has to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie </s>
<s> his religious beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern and his religious faith makes possible fortitude equanimity and consolation enabling him to endure colossal misfortune fear frustration uncertainty suffering evil and danger </s>
<s> religion usually also includes a principle of compensation mainly in a promised perfect future state </s>
<s> the belief in immortality where held functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here and now </s>
<s> the tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession repentance and penance </s>
<s> the feeling of individual inferiority defeat or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly but all-victorious father-god as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies </s>
<s> in providing for these inner individual functions religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is no other institution </s>
<s> in addition to the functions of religion within man there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society </s>
<s> the two have never been separable </s>
<s> religion is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation </s>
<s> the value-system of a community or society is always correlated with and to a degree dependent upon a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions </s>
<s> the religion supports re-enforces reaffirms and maintains the fundamental values </s>
<s> even in the united states with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation there is a general consensus regarding the basic christian values </s>
<s> this is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere </s>
<s> for example americans rally to christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism </s>
<s> in america also all of our major religious bodies officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of our common religion </s>
<s> furthermore religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of god to the intermediary and subordinate values </s>
<s> for example those regarding material objects and pragmatic ends </s>
<s> finally it gives sanctity more than human legitimacy and even through super-empirical reference transcendent and supernatural importance to some values </s>
<s> for example marriage as a sacrament much law-breaking as sinful occasionally the state as a divine instrument </s>
<s> it places certain values at least beyond questioning and tampering </s>
<s> closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends </s>
<s> this something leads to a conception of an over-all social plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends </s>
<s> for example a plan that fulfills the will of god which advances the kingdom of god which involves social life as part of the grand design </s>
<s> this explains some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy </s>
<s> it gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action </s>
<s> finally it gives meaning to much social endeavor and logic consistency and meaning to life </s>
<s> in general there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends </s>
<s> religion integrates and unifies </s>
<s> some of the oldest most persistent and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion </s>
<s> these groups have varied widely from mere families primitive totemic groups and small modern cults and sects to the memberships of great denominations and great widely dispersed world religions </s>
<s> religion fosters group life in various ways </s>
<s> the common ultimate values ends and goals fostered by religion are a most important factor </s>
<s> without a system of values there can be no society </s>
<s> where such a value system prevails it always unifies all who possess it </s>
<s> it enables members of the society to operate as a system </s>
<s> the beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in creeds dogmas and doctrines and form what durkheim calls a credo </s>
<s> as he points out a religious group cannot exist without a collective credo and the more extensive the credo the more unified and strong is the group </s>
<s> the credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine </s>
<s> the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine the firmer the group </s>
<s> the religious symbolism and especially the closely related rites and worship forms constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith </s>
<s> the religion in fact is an expression of the unity of the group small or large </s>
<s> the common codes for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior bind the devotees together </s>
<s> these are ways of jointly participating in significantly symbolized standardized and ordered religiously sanctified behavior </s>

<s> his view is that every religion pertains to a community and conversely every community is in one aspect a religious unit </s>
<s> this is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semi-public and public occasions in the united states </s>
<s> and it is evidenced in the prayers offered in the frequent religious allusions and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds </s>
<s> the unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units with religion as the dominant bond even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized </s>
<s> religion usually exercises a stabilizing-conserving function </s>
<s> as such it acts as an anchor for the people </s>
<s> there is a marked tendency for religions once firmly established to resist change not only in their own doctrines and policies and practices but also in secular affairs having religious relevance </s>
<s> it has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values though also in some measure an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones </s>
<s> it tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments the traditional ways of thinking and the customary ways of living </s>
<s> historically religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication enforcement sanction and perpetuation of various other institutions </s>
<s> at the same time that religion exercises a conserving influence it also energizes and motivates both individuals and groups </s>
<s> much of the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives </s>
<s> the great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices </s>
<s> for example the crusades mission efforts just wars </s>
<s> much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion </s>
<s> the insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects </s>
<s> religion provides the most attractive rewards either in this world or the next for those who not merely abide by its norms but who engage in good works </s>
<s> religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control enforcing what men should or should not do </s>
<s> among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group </s>
<s> and in modern societies such influence is still great </s>
<s> religion has its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now </s>
<s> thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem </s>
<s> clearly this was a family in crisis </s>
<s> her previous traumatic experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday </s>
<s> abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss abandonment and annihilation produced further relief of tension </s>
<s> as seen in the b family there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance </s>
<s> the unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled transference </s>
<s> in general the approach is more active than passive more out-reaching than reflective </s>
<s> while some regression is inevitable it is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy </s>
<s> these needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension </s>
<s> the initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking sense </s>
<s> in so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness generally associated with the first stages of stress impact </s>
<s> thus the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf </s>
<s> here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation </s>
<s> we are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue regression unhealthy suppression and repression excessive use of denial and crippling guilt turned against the self </s>
<s> in steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive responses the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques of specific emotional support clarification and anticipatory guidance </s>
<s> then too the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits single and group office interviews and appropriate telephone follow-up calls if the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention </s>
<s> at certain critical stages and only for sound diagnostic reasons it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive rather than defeating </s>
<s> finally whatever the techniques used a twin goal is common to all preventive casework service to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to mobilize and use their ego capacities </s>
<s> we should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of values locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top instead of seeing the services as part of a continuum each important in its own right </s>
<s> this problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself </s>
<s> almost three decades ago bertha reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services </s>
<s> thus casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended </s>
<s> that we are experiencing an upsurge of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature </s>
<s> for example the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project </s>
<s> these reports refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people </s>
<s> in some programs treatment is concentrated over a short period of time while in others after the initial contact is established flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success </s>
<s> ideally brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance </s>
<s> our literature is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the globally utopian </s>
<s> probably in the immediate future we will have to settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models </s>
<s> increased experimentation with multipurpose agencies especially those that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare services holds rich promise for the future </s>
<s> for example child welfare experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships </s>
<s> sentiment </s>
<s> tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling </s>
<s> one of the devices for tension management is preferential mating </s>
<s> the preferential mating of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study </s>
<s> the relative geographical isolation of the brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating </s>
<s> it would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society </s>
<s> the supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation </s>
<s> the newlyweds building homes on the same land with either set of parents and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship </s>
<s> achieving </s>
<s> maintenance of the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today </s>
<s> yet the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war </s>
<s> norms </s>
<s> the process of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements </s>
<s> the elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population </s>
<s> core - marginal marriages still belong in the category of permissive unions </s>
<s> status-roles </s>
<s> the element of status-roles and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of conjectures about them </s>
<s> power </s>
<s> there is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power primarily the voluntary influence of non-authoritative power has been exerted on actors in the system particularly in regard to mate selection </s>
<s> again size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls </s>
<s> ranking </s>
<s> interviews with members of the brandywine population were attempted in order to discover the ranking of the various families in the population </s>
<s> the large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the upper positions </s>
<s> loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation process </s>
<s> despite the increasing rate of exogamous marriages the population has been able to sustain at least to some degree the consciousness of its intermediate status in society </s>
<s> the adherence of many in the population to the indian background in their pedigree and emphasis upon the fact that their ancestors had never been slaves becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate status of the group in society </s>
<s> sanctions </s>
<s> the negative sanctions applied to core - negro marriages for core members act as indicators of expected adherence to group norms </s>
<s> however because of church laws lately more stringently enforced which forbid the marriage of cousins closely related consanguineously a means of facilitating the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate unions </s>
<s> a cursory survey of available material indicates a high rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous relationship </s>
<s> subsystems </s>
<s> the comprehensive or master processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system and subsystems </s>
<s> within the larger social system are the structural and functional subsystems </s>
<s> subgroups of various types interconnected by relational norms </s>
<s> regulative norms governing subgroups and roles </s>
<s> cultural values </s>
<s> subgroups of various types have been found within this system </s>
<s> each family line can be considered a substructure </s>
<s> there seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group </s>
<s> additionally the proscription of core - negro marriages for core families discussed above would seem to act as a regulative norm governing subgroups and roles </s>
<s> the scope of this study does not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the subgroups </s>
<s> however it cannot be presumed informal though the structure of the population seems that there are not well-defined roles within the system </s>
<s> the present study relates to the theory of functional systems </s>
<s> it is hypothesized that fertility is a function of the social system when the population as a whole is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division of core families and marginal families is considered </s>
<s> the four functional problems of a social system are to some extent solved by the subsystems within this population </s>
<s> by means of geographical isolation and high fertility rates inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained </s>
<s> in order to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension the high fertility rate provides more group members for mate selection and the clustering of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls </s>
<s> as mentioned above where families are concentrated in larger numbers group controls seem strongest and most effective </s>
<s> adaptation to the social and non-social environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational segregation </s>
<s> this provides the necessary contact with the larger society while supporting a type of control over members in terms of social contacts </s>
<s> the problem of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values </s>
<s> the values placed by the brandywine population upon maintaining a certain homogeneity a certain separate racial identity and therefore a certain separate social status are important for the morale of the system </s>
<s> since morale is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration the higher the morale and solidarity the better the system can solve the problems of the system </s>
<s> in this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the brandywine population and the white and negro populations within the same general locality the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the brandywine population </s>
<s> it is conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation </s>
<s> in turn higher fertility rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity </s>
<s> the population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger </s>
<s> master processes </s>
<s> of particular utility in the analysis of the development persistence and change of social systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes </s>
<s> loomis considers six such processes in his paradigm </s>
<s> communication </s>
<s> boundary maintenance </s>
<s> systemic linkage </s>
<s> socialization </s>
<s> social control </s>
<s> institutionalization though undoubtedly all six processes are operative within the whole social system and its subsystems two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be singled out for particular emphasis </s>
<s> communication </s>
<s> communication may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger community </s>
<s> intense interaction is easier where segregated living and occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community as in the case of this population </s>
<s> however the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation </s>
<s> urbanization appears to be an important factor in the disintegration of this group </s>
<s> this conclusion is however an over-simplification </s>
<s> a more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that brandywine people in the urban-fringe area are in general less segregated locally than group members in rural areas </s>
<s> in the urban area in other words they unlike some urban ethnic groups do not concentrate in ghetto colonies </s>
<s> group pressures toward conformity are slight or non-existent and deviant behavior in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions </s>
<s> in such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily in mate selection behavior </s>
<s> social control </s>
<s> by means of this social control deviance is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group </s>
<s> examples from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned by ostracism from the group </s>
<s> socialization </s>
<s> there is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society </s>
<s> confused and divided though this tradition may be it is an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group and acts as a means of socialization particularly for members of the rural community </s>
<s> boundary maintenance </s>
<s> the process of boundary maintenance identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems and the characteristic interaction is maintained </s>
<s> the fertility rate pattern would seem to be a function though a latent one of the process of maintaining the boundary </s>
<s> it is also expressed in the proscription against deviants in the matter of endogamy particularly in rural areas </s>
<s> by their pattern of endogamy and exogamy the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain </s>
<s> systemic linkage </s>
<s> but specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors </s>
<s> tribal authorities the chiefs and their secretaries were held responsible for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories under the general supervision of district officials </s>
<s> the district officials along with their other duties were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics </s>
<s> additional entries must be made from time to time </s>
<s> different cards are used for males and females and a corner is clipped from the cards of adults and of children when they reach puberty </s>
<s> so a quick count could be made at any time even by an illiterate clerk of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes </s>
<s> personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments inoculations periods of employment and changes of residence are recorded </s>
<s> each adult is held personally responsible for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand </s>
<s> the registration card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons </s>
<s> the cards of permanent out-migrants are in theory sent to an office in the place of new residence </s>
<s> finally the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions </s>
<s> numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes were counted each year </s>
<s> the results of these inquiries were used to adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various ratios and rates by districts including birth and death rates general fertility rates distributions by marital status fertility of wives separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households infant mortality and migration </s>
<s> the areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials supposedly as representative of a larger population </s>
<s> averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population </s>
<s> the scheme in theory is an ingenious adaptation of european registration systems to the conditions of african life </s>
<s> the sampling program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies </s>
<s> the system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers </s>
<s> so the results are subject to considerable confusion </s>
<s> the system tended to break down during the war but was reactivated </s>
<s> but the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading </s>
<s> the same system with minor modifications was developed in ruanda-urundi under belgian administration </s>
<s> here again it seems that useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war periods </s>
<s> before considering more recent activities we should note another important aspect of demography in belgian africa </s>
<s> a number of strong independent agencies established in some cases with governmental or royal support have conducted large medical social educational and research operations in particular parts of the congo and ruanda-urundi </s>
<s> somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas </s>
<s> other independent or partially independent agencies have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related to demography </s>
<s> these studies vary widely in scope and precision </s>
<s> the results are now being analyzed </s>
<s> statistics have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the congo and in ruanda-urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs </s>
<s> the aimo organizations of both countries which maintain administrative services throughout the territories retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information </s>
<s> however the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics </s>
<s> eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the congo was transferred to the demographic division of the central statistical office </s>
<s> we will deal first with the program in the congo though this was put into operation later than the other </s>
<s> the radical nature of the innovation in the congo was not emphasized in the official announcements </s>
<s> the term enquetes demographiques previously used for the supplementary investigations carried out in connection with the administrative censuses was used for the new investigations </s>
<s> however the differences in procedure are fundamental </s>
<s> these teams carried out the same operations successively in different areas </s>
<s> sample areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits </s>
<s> in short scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling </s>
<s> different sampling ratios were applied under different conditions </s>
<s> higher proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas </s>
<s> uniform questions definitions and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country </s>
<s> the population registration system still has important functions </s>
<s> it supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations </s>
<s> it provides a frame for the sampling census </s>
<s> it is still used in making current population estimates in post-census years though the value of these estimates is open to question </s>
<s> finally it may have certain very important less obvious values </s>
<s> the quality of the census data can therefore be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries </s>
<s> it is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses be carried out at five-year intervals </s>
<s> other reports in identical form but with somewhat varying content have been issued </s>
<s> these area reports will be followed according to present plans by a summary report which will include a detailed statement on methods </s>
<s> with this evidence in mind the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes </s>
<s> he found as he had suspected a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students </s>
<s> in their own words it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time </s>
<s> but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent </s>
<s> all of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course </s>
<s> a few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students </s>
<s> i can now better see just what processes provoked certain actions from me in the past </s>
<s> this comment and others similar to it would seem to indicate a possible justification for continuing the status quo </s>
<s> but the weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction </s>
<s> but only those already married could enroll in this one section </s>
<s> in addition two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted </s>
<s> this one did </s>
<s> this action was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become sophomores </s>
<s> many of them appear to drop out for one reason or another </s>
<s> by permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it </s>
<s> this has subsequently been verified by the experience </s>
<s> in the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged </s>
<s> the philosophy has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively </s>
<s> besides auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students </s>
<s> but in this one section we welcomed auditors </s>
<s> many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum especially in the various engineering fields with few electives till the senior year </s>
<s> this experimental class represented quite a variety of students </s>
<s> it ranged from a freshman woman just married through the various academic growth stages including one senior-graduate student to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended </s>
<s> it ranged from two women members who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive </s>
<s> some of these speculations may have some merit others are somewhat ambiguous </s>
<s> but few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different in marriage than in a pre-marital situation </s>
<s> the writer began this special class by explaining his background thinking for creating such a section in the first place </s>
<s> he made it clear from the beginning that this was the students opportunity and that the future destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one </s>
<s> this is to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods nor a course in how to raise children </s>
<s> we already have courses covering those problems and so on </s>
<s> but within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible </s>
<s> a steering committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate the direction and pace the class was taking </s>
<s> films were used as with all sections but with one big difference </s>
<s> our campus unfortunately owns no films </s>
<s> since they are all either rented or borrowed the requested dates for their use have to be far in advance </s>
<s> the writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be </s>
<s> for example the steering committee might announce that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched </s>
<s> nevertheless the writer has never experienced such spontaneity of discussion after film showings </s>
<s> though it did not become known to the writer for some time a nucleus group had sprung up within the class </s>
<s> they began to meet in the evenings and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class </s>
<s> from a few students this group gradually increased to include over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class and many outsiders as well </s>
<s> also although only a few of the students were intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning most reported that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships were with members of that class </s>
<s> in fact they often revamped their social activities to include class members previously unknown </s>
<s> supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the other sections the major difference being that there was a noticeably deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group </s>
<s> these students although they might read various articles in popular magazines more often chose to report on articles found in the journals </s>
<s> in addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read </s>
<s> whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest </s>
<s> in the main this course took the following directional high roads </s>
<s> in short it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy </s>
<s> as an example of this last facet there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement </s>
<s> since the course one member has lost her husband </s>
<s> but just when was an unknown and of course the longer it did not happen the stronger her wish and belief that it might not </s>
<s> since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis </s>
<s> quite frequently class members brought questions from their mates at home </s>
<s> these were often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them </s>
<s> this added a personal zest to class discussions and participation </s>
<s> both sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely enlightening </s>
<s> the writer sensed a much freer and more frank discussion especially of this one area than ever before </s>
<s> he felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that orgasm as a criterion is not nearly so essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might think </s>
<s> this was probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time and again </s>
<s> on the other hand the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with love as most women seem to do </s>
<s> perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent </s>
<s> never in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various stages of pregnancy </s>
<s> there was a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented from a childless couple to and including every trimester </s>
<s> in fact we had one birth before the end of the course and another student had to take the final examiantion a week early just to be on the safe side </s>
<s> there was also one spontaneous abortion during the semester </s>
<s> this was true mostly of those kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action </s>
<s> guilford-martin personality inventories </s>
<s> guilford-martin </s>
<s> these were the same subjects who were given the rorschach test </s>
<s> some predictions had been made concerning factors r n i and co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity </s>
<s> one prediction had been made about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not </s>
<s> level </s>
<s> discussion </s>
<s> individual differences </s>
<s> individual differences in kohnstamm reactivity to controlled kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study </s>
<s> among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred </s>
<s> one subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax </s>
<s> those who responded with an arm-elevation in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion </s>
<s> this information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show arm-levitation must be preventing it </s>
<s> these subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried </s>
<s> in no way either verbally or behaviorally did the experimenter indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary contraction </s>
<s> moreover when the experimenter did inform those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed the kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced in their subsequent reactions to the kohnstamm situation </s>
<s> they continued to give an arm-elevation </s>
<s> a differential suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their naive kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion </s>
<s> while they were told that there were some normal people who reacted differently than they had they were also informed that there were other normals who reacted as they had </s>
<s> they were not free to be themselves in this situation an interpersonal one where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior </s>
<s> while other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in kohnstamm reactivity it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior </s>
<s> this subject who has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years did not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized conditions used in this experiment while sober </s>
<s> after two drinks containing alcohol her arm flew upward very freely </s>
<s> there was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement </s>
<s> she ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls </s>
<s> these suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had </s>
<s> the kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control </s>
<s> they explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors </s>
<s> they felt that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction </s>
<s> this subject was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first </s>
<s> she had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial but had consciously prevented it from so doing </s>
<s> in contrast to this voluntary-control explanation for nonreactivity given by the kohnstamm-positive subjects the kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity </s>
<s> they felt that they were relaxing as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level </s>
<s> the above discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in abeyance in the kohnstamm-positive subjects </s>
<s> but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation </s>
<s> she then described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she relinquished control </s>
<s> however she was able to relax and yield to the moment </s>
<s> it is our hypothesis that kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are kohnstamm-negative subjects </s>
<s> that they can give up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors </s>
<s> it is our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below </s>
<s> thus this readiness to relax controls evidenced in the kohnstamm situation appears to be a more general personality factor </s>
<s> aniseikonic illusion </s>
<s> the kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world </s>
<s> there was a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline </s>
<s> this occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going downhill </s>
<s> they knew that their perceptual experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the aniseikonic lenses </s>
<s> yet they were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be </s>
<s> the change in perceptions by some of the kohnstamm-negative subjects after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations </s>
<s> they were able to experience at first in terms of past conventionality </s>
<s> when informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions they were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present </s>
<s> it might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong </s>
<s> while the interpretations that have been given are inferences only they gain support from such comments as the following which was made by one of the kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not on the first trial perceive the tilt illusion </s>
<s> control of socioeconomic status </s>
<s> it would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated the degree of structure in teaching method </s>
<s> the structured schools were in an industrial city with three-family tenement houses typical of the residential areas but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes </s>
<s> the unstructured schools were in a large suburban community predominantly middle- to upper-middle class but fringed by an industrial area </s>
<s> in order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods </s>
<s> school principals and guidance workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas </s>
<s> an objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data </s>
<s> equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods </s>
<s> subjects </s>
<s> individual differences in maturation and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement </s>
<s> therefore third-grade children were chosen as subjects for this study </s>
<s> the subjects for this study were randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution one-third as underachievers one-third medium and one-third over-achievers </s>
<s> children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total third-grade school population were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection </s>
<s> over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system </s>
<s> the final sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores </s>
<s> administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools </s>
<s> it was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation </s>
<s> rating scale of compulsivity </s>
<s> an interview schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire were prepared and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home </s>
<s> the rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records </s>
<s> final ratings were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that was deviant from the discovered norms </s>
<s> children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals </s>
<s> the low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters </s>
<s> measurement of anxiety </s>
<s> castaneda et al revised the taylor anxiety scale for use with children </s>
<s> the taylor scale was adapted from the minnesota multiphastic personality inventory with item selection based upon clinical definitions of anxiety </s>
<s> there is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees </s>
<s> although the taylor scale was designed as a group testing device in this study it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children in reading the items </s>
<s> relationship of anxiety to compulsivity </s>
<s> the question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity </s>
<s> the two ratings yield a correlation of which is not significantly different from zero </s>
<s> therefore we have measured two different characteristics </s>
<s> in theory compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer </s>
<s> the issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later </s>
<s> criterion measurement </s>
<s> in establishing criterion measurements it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself </s>
<s> the predicted interaction effect should if potent extend its influence over all academic achievement </s>
<s> the stanford achievement test form j was administered by classroom teachers consisting of a battery of six sub-tests paragraph meaning word meaning spelling language arithmetic computation and arithmetic reasoning </s>
<s> all of these sub-tests involve reading except arithmetic computation </s>
<s> scores are stated in grade-equivalents on a national norm </s>
<s> the battery median grade-equivalent was used in data analysis in this study </s>
<s> the wechsler intelligence scale for children was administered to each sample third-grade child by a clinical worker </s>
<s> therefore in the investigation of the present hypothesis it was necessary to control this factor </s>
<s> the criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement </s>
<s> it is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the iq </s>
<s> in this manner the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables </s>
<s> results </s>
<s> test of interaction of compulsivity and teaching methods </s>
<s> no significant difference was found in achievement between high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school </s>
<s> the hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported in this case at the level </s>
<s> while we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives </s>
<s> indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant </s>
<s> possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure </s>
<s> our conjecture is then that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work </s>
<s> when helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation then and only then does such a child attain unusual success </s>
<s> test of interaction of anxiety and teaching methods </s>
<s> the interaction effect which is significant at the level can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores </s>
<s> the most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools </s>
<s> according to the theory proposed this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment </s>
<s> the fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or under-achievement these children exhibit </s>
<s> the child with high anxiety may first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem </s>
<s> failure confirms the threat and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the decrement in performance is pronounced </s>
<s> the individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination </s>
<s> but the symbols he is asked to learn are simple </s>
<s> as shown earlier the highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements </s>
<s> success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved </s>
<s> by the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words </s>
<s> apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or panicked </s>
<s> sarason et al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like situation and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher </s>
<s> although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations the results do not confirm their conclusion </s>
<s> observers in the two school systems studied here judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting </s>
<s> yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting </s>
<s> analysis </s>
<s> analysis means the evaluation of subparts the comparative ratings of parts the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements </s>
<s> analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts </s>
<s> impersonal purposes </s>
<s> up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals </s>
<s> roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose to evaluate procedures regardless of individuals </s>
<s> for example a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying </s>
<s> examples </s>
<s> let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis </s>
<s> one should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas </s>
<s> evaluation </s>
<s> the president of a small firm selling restaurant products had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business </s>
<s> in place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires checking their references interviewing them asking them to be tried out he told them he would prefer to test them </s>
<s> each person was to enter the testing room carrying a suitcase of samples </s>
<s> each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product </s>
<s> in the testing room he was to make successively three presentations to three different people </s>
<s> in the testing room three of the veteran salesmen served as antagonists </s>
<s> one handled the salesman in a friendly manner another in a rough manner and the third in a hesitating manner </s>
<s> each was told to purchase material if he felt like it </s>
<s> the antagonists came in one at a time and did not see or hear the other presentations </s>
<s> after each presentation the antagonist wrote his judgment of the salesmen </s>
<s> and so did the observers consisting of the president three of his salesmen and a psychologist </s>
<s> ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon </s>
<s> this procedure was repeated one day a month for four months </s>
<s> the batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three </s>
<s> the president of the firm calculating expenses alone felt his costs had dropped one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent </s>
<s> another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work </s>
<s> the position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions </s>
<s> all applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist </s>
<s> somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist showing wit sparkle and aplomb </s>
<s> she was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day </s>
<s> analysis </s>
<s> in considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning </s>
<s> some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure </s>
<s> an engineer had been made the works manager of a firm supplanting a retired employee who had been considered outstandingly successful </s>
<s> however he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position </s>
<s> he seemed to antagonize everyone </s>
<s> turnover rates of personnel went up production dropped and morale was visibly reduced </s>
<s> despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer he seemed to be a very poor administrator although no one quite knew what was wrong with him </s>
<s> he played a number of typical situations before observers other supervisors who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong </s>
<s> entirely concerned with efficiency he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes condemning them to too great an extent </s>
<s> the entire group of managers explained in great detail a number of human relations errors that he made </s>
<s> one by one these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors </s>
<s> he admitted his behavior and defended it </s>
<s> after the diagnosing he left the course convinced that it could do him no good </s>
<s> we may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment </s>
<s> we may say that his attitude was foolish since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills </s>
<s> or we may say that his attitude was commendable showing his independence of mind in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others </s>
<s> in any case he refused to accept the implications of the analysis that he needed to be made over </s>
<s> another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis </s>
<s> in a course for supermarket operators a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time </s>
<s> on playing some typical situations before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated as unsatisfactory </s>
<s> in short as frequently happens in analyses the individual feels threatened and defends himself </s>
<s> however in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways </s>
<s> the necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms </s>
<s> how this was accomplished may be described since this sometimes is a crucial problem </s>
<s> these errors were then collected and written on a blackboard condensing similar ideas </s>
<s> eighteen errors were located and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors </s>
<s> the manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard </s>
<s> no comments were made during the voting </s>
<s> the results looked as follows af </s>
<s> the first eight of these eighteen statements which received at least one-half of the votes were duplicated to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager and when this particular manager roleplayed in other situations the members checked any items that appeared </s>
<s> summary </s>
<s> we can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves and others can see us better than we see ourselves </s>
<s> to learn what we do is the first step for improvement </s>
<s> to accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step </s>
<s> to want to change is the third step </s>
<s> to practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the fourth step </s>
<s> to use these new ways in daily life is the last step </s>
<s> roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training </s>
<s> when an evaluative situation is set up and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation </s>
<s> observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion </s>
<s> while roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time it represents one of the major uses of this procedure </s>
<s> the objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts </s>
<s> in addition the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will be reviewed </s>
<s> the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area </s>
<s> the reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold </s>
<s> spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new </s>
<s> the content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition as if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove </s>
<s> only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom common to our culture which he has evidently heard over and over from a parent until he experiences it as part of him </s>
<s> one hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion during which despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks i felt only a cold annoyance with her </s>
<s> at first i did not know what she meant </s>
<s> i thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother in their distant home-city </s>
<s> then i realized that she had been deliberately showing me this time what granny was like </s>
<s> and when i replied in this spirit she corroborated my hunch </s>
<s> i could evoke no further elaboration from her about this </s>
<s> again i at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication and i quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak with such utter conviction of an opinion held by my father now several years deceased </s>
<s> she looked confused at this and i felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make </s>
<s> she clearly agreed that this had been the case </s>
<s> i realized now that she had been showing me in what impressed me as being a very accurate way something her mother had once said to her </s>
<s> it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her </s>
<s> what had been an unmanageably powerful introject was now despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like </s>
<s> earlier this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times when she was in her room alone it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice </s>
<s> particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the therapist some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware and the recognition of which as a part of himself he finds distinctly unwelcome </s>
<s> i have found time and again that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests in the final analysis on this basis </s>
<s> another patient a paranoid woman for many months infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her fellow patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met </s>
<s> condensation </s>
<s> here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated or reduced in their communicative expression to some comparatively simple-seeming verbal or nonverbal statement </s>
<s> one finds for example that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings and the most unconventional of meanings </s>
<s> one cannot assume of course that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy or at any one time later on when the stereotype was uttered </s>
<s> but it is true that the therapist can sense when he hears this stereotype that there are at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it a blurred babel of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another </s>
<s> a hebephrenic man used to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his largely-silent hours with his therapist </s>
<s> of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression that which seems best to give release and communicational expression to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter </s>
<s> and which more often than all these conveys a welter of feelings which could in no way be conveyed by any number of words words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another </s>
<s> in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch or the passage of flatus not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute forms of communication in which from time to time quite different things are being said long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these as distinct feelings and concepts to say them in words </s>
<s> thus he may be referring to some concrete thing or incident in his immediate environment by some symbolic-sounding hyperbolic reference to transcendental events on the global scene </s>
<s> of such hidden meanings the patient himself is more often than not entirely unaware </s>
<s> his subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one </s>
<s> a borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding in a most articulate fashion during session after session with me were like great cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him </s>
<s> as he spoke i was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung high in the air from a docked steamship </s>
<s> a significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized especially for a highly inflected language such as russian </s>
<s> for english the reduction in size is less striking </s>
<s> the logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file </s>
<s> implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis </s>
<s> we suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem </s>
<s> we propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text </s>
<s> we accomplish this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer </s>
<s> a random-storage scheme based on the spelling of forms provides an economical way to compile this text-form list </s>
<s> dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked </s>
<s> a location in the computer store is also named for each marked form </s>
<s> dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text </s>
<s> the dictionary is a form dictionary at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries </s>
<s> also the dictionary is divided into at least two parts the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms </s>
<s> text lookup as we will describe it consists of three steps </s>
<s> the first is compiling a list of text forms assigning an information cell to each and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence </s>
<s> for this step the computer memory is separated into three regions cells in the w-region are used for storage of the forms in the text-form list </s>
<s> cells in the x-region and y region are reserved as information cells for text forms </s>
<s> when an occurrence af is isolated during text reading a random memory address af the address of a cell in the x-region is computed from the form of af </s>
<s> let af denote the form of af </s>
<s> if cell af has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form list it is now assigned as the information cell of af </s>
<s> the form itself is stored in the next available cells of the w-region beginning in cell af </s>
<s> the address af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in af </s>
<s> the information cell af is saved to represent the text occurrence </s>
<s> text reading continues with the next occurrence </s>
<s> let us assume that af is identical to the form of an occurrence af which preceded af in the text </s>
<s> when this situation exists the address af will equal af which was produced from af </s>
<s> if af was assigned as the information cell for af the routine can detect that af is identical to af by comparing af with the form stored at location af </s>
<s> the address af is stored in the cell af </s>
<s> when as in this case the two forms match the address af is saved to represent the occurrence af </s>
<s> text reading continues with the next occurrence </s>
<s> a third situation is possible </s>
<s> the formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form </s>
<s> thus when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the x-region a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms one cell in the chain for each form </s>
<s> if af leads to an address af that is equal to the address computed from af even though af does not match af the chain of information cells is extended from af by storing the address of the next available cell in the y-region af in af </s>
<s> the cell af becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of af </s>
<s> a third cell can be added by storing the address of another y-cell in af </s>
<s> similarly as many cells are added as are required </s>
<s> each information cell in the chain contains the address of the y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is stored </s>
<s> each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the y-cell that is the next element of the chain </s>
<s> the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain </s>
<s> hence when the address af is computed from af the cell af and all y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain </s>
<s> when the information cell for af has been determined it is saved as a representation of af </s>
<s> text reading continues with the next occurrence </s>
<s> text reading is terminated when a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list </s>
<s> each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list </s>
<s> each time a dictionary form matches a text form the information cell of the matching text form is saved </s>
<s> the number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved </s>
<s> these two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage </s>
<s> if each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read </s>
<s> the appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time </s>
<s> each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading </s>
<s> a random address af that lies within the x-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form </s>
<s> if cell af is an information cell it and any information cells in the y-region that have been linked to af each contain an address in the w-region where a potentially matching form is stored </s>
<s> the dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms </s>
<s> when a match is found an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage </s>
<s> if cell af is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list </s>
<s> these two steps essentially complete the lookup operation </s>
<s> the final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text </s>
<s> the list of text forms in the w-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the x and y-regions are no longer required </s>
<s> only the assignment of the information cells is important </s>
<s> the first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text </s>
<s> the grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis </s>
<s> a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence </s>
<s> the grammatical descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file </s>
<s> the order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe </s>
<s> when entries are being retrieved from this file the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer </s>
<s> this selection-rejection process takes place as the file is read </s>
<s> each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the aj </s>
<s> the address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form </s>
<s> the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents </s>
<s> hence the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence </s>
<s> the only requirements on dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms </s>
<s> this leaves the ordering of entries variable </s>
<s> two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form </s>
<s> the former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage </s>
<s> the latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents </s>
<s> applying the techniques developed at harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once </s>
<s> an extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatical description of each form </s>
<s> equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context </s>
<s> thus one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form </s>
<s> if all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible </s>
<s> for example the inflected forms of a word can be represented insofar as regular inflection allows by a stem and a set of endings to be attached </s>
<s> similarly if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form </s>
<s> the dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it </s>
<s> when irregularity and variation prevent summarizing information is written in complete detail </s>
<s> entries are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased </s>
<s> in sentences patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here </s>
<s> the tendency is toward putting dominant stress at the end </s>
<s> there is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes </s>
<s> dominant stress is of course more than extended duration and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last </s>
<s> but the parallel is significant </s>
<s> from the point of view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement is the predicator has broken and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking </s>
<s> but dominant stress will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence </s>
<s> in i know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing </s>
<s> in one thing i know it will usually be on the predicator know </s>
<s> in small-town people are very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly </s>
<s> in the double sentence the smaller the town the friendlier the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people </s>
<s> dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist </s>
<s> adverbial second complements however are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences </s>
<s> is george put the cat out dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement the cat not the second complement out </s>
<s> final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress </s>
<s> is george reads the news emotionally dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally </s>
<s> they are likely to lose dominant stress </s>
<s> context is of extreme importance </s>
<s> what is new in the context is likely to be made more prominent than what is not </s>
<s> thus in a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows here but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow dominant stress will probably be on snows </s>
<s> the personal pronouns and substitute one are normally unstressed because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context </s>
<s> but when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious there is normally only light stress or no stress at all </s>
<s> if women replaced people it would normally have dominant stress </s>
<s> in i have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than do </s>
<s> in i know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing </s>
<s> in i knew you when you were a child and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty </s>
<s> dominant stress on pretty would be almost insulting here </s>
<s> often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion </s>
<s> in she has it in for george dominant stress will ordinarily be on in where the notion of stored-up antipathy seems to center </s>
<s> where there is comparison or contrast dominant stresses normally operate to center attention </s>
<s> thus in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for his and sisters but in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters </s>
<s> the desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns of stress of chinese and japanese </s>
<s> sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship </s>
<s> in hunger stimulates man too the situation is very similar </s>
<s> strong stress on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger strong stress on man treats man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger </s>
<s> here again in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context </s>
<s> when a word represents a larger construction of which it is the only expressed part it normally has more stress than it would have in fully expressed construction </s>
<s> the stress on have which here represents have finished reading the paper is quite strong </s>
<s> in of all the suggestions that were made his was the silliest the possessive his represents his suggestion and is stressed </s>
<s> it has strong stress </s>
<s> omission of a subordinator pronoun however does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object </s>
<s> thus to has light stress both in that was the conclusion that i came to and in that was the conclusion i came to </s>
<s> but when to represents to consciousness in that was the moment that i came to and similarly in that was the moment i came to there is much stronger stress on to </s>
<s> in i wanted to tell him but i was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him </s>
<s> in to tell him of course to is normally unstressed </s>
<s> when i have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to i have instructions that i am to leave this place dominant stress is ordinarily on leave </s>
<s> when the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to i have instructions which i am to leave dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions </s>
<s> it is clear that patterns of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written </s>
<s> other examples follow </s>
<s> in the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent to on tuesday there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language </s>
<s> but if a complement for come is implied and by tuesday is a prepositional unit used as an adjunct by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most </s>
<s> in the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless i drink water there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking </s>
<s> but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking water is equivalent to without water for drinking there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water </s>
<s> but the use of stress in comparison and contrast for example can undermine distinctions such as these </s>
<s> and patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by any means </s>
<s> in the steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them and in i looked up the number and i looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second </s>
<s> syllabification </s>
<s> syllables are genuine units but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties </s>
<s> sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear </s>
<s> from the point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables </s>
<s> historically re is the formative that is employed also in republic and al is the common suffix </s>
<s> when ity is added real clearly has two syllables </s>
<s> it is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels </s>
<s> no single explanation is adequate to account for this </s>
<s> improvement however is urgent and at least three things will be needed </s>
<s> the first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses </s>
<s> even beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant systems both in their general outlines and in many specific details </s>
<s> an advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems including some of the more unusual types </s>
<s> by contrast even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple distinction between register and contour languages </s>
<s> this limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone </s>
<s> tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist </s>
<s> papers like these four if widely read will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work </s>
<s> the second need is better field techniques </s>
<s> the great majority of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping types those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed those who are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter </s>
<s> the result has been neglect fumbling efforts or superficial treatment </s>
<s> as these maladies overlap so must the cure </s>
<s> analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple </s>
<s> they will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures </s>
<s> good field techniques will not only equip linguists for better work but also help them overcome negative attitudes </s>
<s> actually none of these papers says much directly about field techniques </s>
<s> but it is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics </s>
<s> these things have been disseminated by other means but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results </s>
<s> the third need is for better theory </s>
<s> we should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels but it has not been </s>
<s> if as i suspect the problem is largely of the second sort then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems </s>
<s> one issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystems </s>
<s> since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis </s>
<s> actual practice does not often work out this way </s>
<s> tone systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal systems </s>
<s> welmers has suggested one explanation </s>
<s> tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use </s>
<s> this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable </s>
<s> the problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features </s>
<s> of course something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component </s>
<s> but in general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude </s>
<s> with tone individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them </s>
<s> pitch differences from one speaker to another or from one emotional state to another may far exceed the small differences between tones </s>
<s> however any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone or in developing a realistic attitude about tone but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded </s>
<s> a second explanation is suggested by the material described in rowlands paper </s>
<s> tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed </s>
<s> neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other </s>
<s> other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way </s>
<s> for example duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation </s>
<s> some phonetic features for example glottal catch or murmur are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual systems </s>
<s> but no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some languages </s>
<s> this explanation of tone difficulties however does not apply in all languages </s>
<s> in many of the syllables intonation can be safely ignored and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation </s>
<s> still even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect </s>
<s> there we see a basically simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic system </s>
<s> while the phonemes can be very easily stated no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences can be related in some way to morphemic units ie until the morphophonemics is worked out or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success </s>
<s> the phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic systems however are very different </s>
<s> the inventory of tones is much smaller and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension pitch level </s>
<s> consonantal systems are not merely larger they are multidimensional </s>
<s> morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system </s>
<s> the possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous and only a small portion of them are actually used </s>
<s> phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system </s>
<s> tonal morphophonemics in a common case can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone </s>
<s> the possibilities are few and the total number of rules may be considerably greater </s>
<s> often therefore there are a number of rules having the same effect and commonly other sets of rules as well having the opposite effect </s>
<s> tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics even when the total number of rules is no greater </s>
<s> this hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more puzzling than consonantal systems </s>
<s> the statement of the system is a different matter </s>
<s> smaller systems can of course be stated much more succinctly </s>
<s> a phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics </s>
<s> the design of orthographies has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves </s>
<s> there has been a tendency on the part of many american linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance </s>
<s> this seems naive </s>
<s> most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies </s>
<s> apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs </s>
<s> the result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic esthetics which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried over from european languages </s>
<s> many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent </s>
<s> as a result many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion </s>
<s> a e sharp in vowel-length and syllabicity in kikuyu examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail </s>
<s> to do so he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail </s>
<s> in the process he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult </s>
<s> a few of his examples are of very great interest and the whole discussion of some importance for theory </s>
<s> his orthographic recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one hand or of superficiality on the other </s>
<s> rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness </s>
<s> he concludes that some changes can be made in the current orthography which will appreciably improve its usefulness but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices to effect these changes </s>
<s> i hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in kikuyu circles </s>
<s> this however will not exhaust their practical usefulness as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design </s>
<s> we need many more studies of this sort if the design of written languages is to be put on a sound basis </s>
<s> one other paper deals with a phonologic problem vowel harmony in igbo by j carnochan </s>
<s> this restates the already widely known facts in terms of prosodies </s>
<s> as a restatement it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of igbo </s>
<s> but it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of igbo phonology </s>
<s> it does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described </s>
<s> but it does not as it claims demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods </s>
<s> it seems to me that it rather easily can </s>
<s> five of the papers deal with grammatical problems </s>
<s> on the whole they maintain much the same high standard but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter </s>
<s> my comments must be briefer than the papers deserve </s>
<s> w h whiteley writes on the verbal radical in iraqw </s>
<s> this must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early a short description of item-categories in iraqw </s>
<s> it exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms </s>
<s> the treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point </s>
<s> there are more stems per item in athabascan which expresses the fact that the athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-athabascan than the yokuts languages from proto-yokuts </s>
<s> this may be because the athabascan divergence began earlier </s>
<s> or both </s>
<s> the greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used </s>
<s> swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal </s>
<s> i one that was specifically adapted to the san joaquin valley </s>
<s> the groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as in size </s>
<s> or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the athabascan verb </s>
<s> more word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question </s>
<s> if word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually </s>
<s> the three others had to be spread somewhat and are headed respectively af </s>
<s> af </s>
<s> and af stems </s>
<s> this distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart af </s>
<s> his second conclusion on semantic word classes agrees with mine </s>
<s> this second conclusion independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are cannot be ignored </s>
<s> his formula will have to be weighed may be altered or improved and it should be tested on additional bodies of material </s>
<s> but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance </s>
<s> and gleason presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area </s>
<s> the problem needs further exploration </s>
<s> or under four stems i set off by asterisks cases where the combined n of stems af was af </s>
<s> these findings and others which will in time be developed will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry </s>
<s> and irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones </s>
<s> it is evident that swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items </s>
<s> it is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible </s>
<s> it is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence </s>
<s> but it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a snare </s>
<s> not that such a list cannot be constructed </s>
<s> but the nearer it comes to attaining universality the less significant will it be linguistically </s>
<s> its terms will tend to be labile or vague and they will fit actual languages more and more badly </s>
<s> the practical operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison </s>
<s> the most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible </s>
<s> in proportion as meanings are concrete we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive </s>
<s> an elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious common-sense indubitable identity as do an eye or tooth or nail </s>
<s> they isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence </s>
<s> and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities </s>
<s> with the universal list as his weapon swadesh has extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past eight ten twelve millennia back </s>
<s> and he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between all western hemisphere languages </s>
<s> some of this may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence </s>
<s> but the farther out he moves the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence and the larger the speculative component in his inferences </s>
<s> he has traversed provinces and kingdoms but he has not consolidated them behind him nor does he control them </s>
<s> he has announced results on hokan penutian uto-aztecan and almost all other american families and phyla and has diagrammed their degree of interrelation </s>
<s> but he has not worked out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other than salish </s>
<s> that is his privilege </s>
<s> but there is also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more remote and elusive external links </s>
<s> of classification first with elapsed age merely a by-product </s>
<s> of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in athabascan in yokuts in uto-aztecan in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them </s>
<s> this involves step-by-step progress and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry </s>
<s> if of the founders of glottochronology swadesh has escaped our steady plodding and lees has repudiated his own share in the founding that is no reason why we should swerve </s>
<s> it seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble solid and limited basis </s>
<s> i would propose first an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list as intrinsically unachievable and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved </s>
<s> i would propose next as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible </s>
<s> there would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable </s>
<s> doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies </s>
<s> it was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after yalta there should be a complete split over germany with hot heads on both sides planning to use the germans against their former allies and with nazi-minded germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other </s>
<s> poland </s>
<s> frontiers </s>
<s> starting in great force late in december from a line stretching from east prussia to budapest the red armies had swept two hundred miles across poland to the oder thirty miles from berlin and the upper danube region was being rapidly overrun while the western allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the rhine </s>
<s> when this proposal was made stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the conference </s>
<s> he stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject </s>
<s> the white russians and the ukrainians would say that stalin and molotov were far less reliable defenders of russia than curzon and clemenceau </s>
<s> yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accepted the curzon line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of poland in some regions </s>
<s> from six to nine million additional germans would be evicted though most would have fled and poland would receive far more from germany than the poor territories including the great pripet marshes which she lost to russia </s>
<s> by this time churchill was not so cordial toward moving poland westward as he had been at teheran where he and eden had both heartily approved the idea </s>
<s> at yalta he thought more about the six million germans who would have to leave trying to find work in germany and roosevelt objected to the western neisse river being chosen in the south instead of the eastern neisse both of which flow into the oder </s>
<s> the issue was left in abeyance presumably for the peace conference </s>
<s> however there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong poland both industrially and agriculturally and one unplagued by large minorities of germans or russians </s>
<s> the moving of millions of the german master-race from the very heart of junkerdom to make room for the polish slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate was a drastic operation but there was little doubt that it was historically justified </s>
<s> government </s>
<s> at yalta the west still believed that eastern europe could be kept in its orbit in spite of the onrushing soviet armies </s>
<s> though little democracy had ever been practised in this region and much of it was still ruled by feudalistic means it was taken for granted that at least the forms of western democracy would be established in this area and western capitalism preserved within it </s>
<s> believing devoutly as they did in anglo-saxon institutions it was important to both roosevelt and churchill that the poles should have them </s>
<s> the issue was acute because the exiled polish government in london supported in the main by britain was still competing with the new lublin government formed behind the red army </s>
<s> more time was spent in trying to marry these incompatibles than over any subject discussed at yalta </s>
<s> roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this issue </s>
<s> it was a matter of principle with churchill since britain had declared war in behalf of poland </s>
<s> to stalin it was a matter of life and death </s>
<s> he made this completely clear </s>
<s> throughout history poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into russia </s>
<s> twice in the last thirty years our enemies the germans have passed through this corridor </s>
<s> it is necessary that poland should be free independent in power </s>
<s> in other words the soviet union was determined to create a poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against germany and so closely tied to russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a cordon sanitaire against the soviets or posing as an independent balancing power in between russia and germany </s>
<s> byrnes says that invariably thereafter the soviets used the same security argument to justify their course in poland </s>
<s> this reasoning was also as inevitable as anything could be </s>
<s> any free elections that were to be held in poland would have to produce a government in which moscow had complete confidence and all pressure from the west for free voting by anti-soviet elements in poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements </s>
<s> liberated europe </s>
<s> other similar affirmations in the declaration on liberated europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the western model </s>
<s> later it developed that the soviets had a very different interpretation of democracy which will be discussed later and their judgment never told them that the big three should unite in establishing democratic conditions as we understand them within their zone of influence </s>
<s> the application of these formulae could not please both sides for they really attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable </s>
<s> while obliged to concede governments in east europe allied with the soviet union instead of opposed to it we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in east europe </s>
<s> we had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world </s>
<s> this is a penetrating description of our post-war illusion which applied to other areas than east europe </s>
<s> here is the best short explanation of the origins of the cold war that has been written </s>
<s> years of war strain and hatred </s>
<s> while the cold war raged it was easy to blame it all on yalta </s>
<s> when the yalta papers were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal by anyone </s>
<s> an analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts </s>
<s> first is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation planning and discussion </s>
<s> preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes </s>
<s> all political interests supported electoral planning although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination </s>
<s> the second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration nomination and voting </s>
<s> considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach </s>
<s> however the regionally differentiated results which appear below in tables are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances </s>
<s> a third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy is the results of the election </s>
<s> the electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation but all vitally interested parties including the government itself were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections </s>
<s> the fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics </s>
<s> elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence </s>
<s> they were stressed in the speeches of si mubarak bekkai when the first council of ministers was formed and again when the istiqlal took a leading role in the second council </s>
<s> from the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in moroccan politics precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government </s>
<s> despite the internal and international crises that harassed morocco the elections remained a central issue </s>
<s> they were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new constructive national effort </s>
<s> to minimize the chances of repeating the balafrej debacle the ibrahim government was formed </s>
<s> a titre personnel and a special office was created in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the elections </s>
<s> by this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete </s>
<s> there remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the labyrinth of palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions </s>
<s> from the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results </s>
<s> in the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental and sometimes bitter differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance </s>
<s> in the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent </s>
<s> those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process </s>
<s> the tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in morocco </s>
<s> at the central level the scrutin uninominal voting system was selected over some form of the scrutin de liste system even though the latter had been recommended by duverger and favored by all political parties </s>
<s> the choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections </s>
<s> although the elections were for local officials it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates </s>
<s> with multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly </s>
<s> both parties and the ministry of the interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and thereby give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance </s>
<s> since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation </s>
<s> the general setting of the moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization </s>
<s> the concentration of effective power in rabat leads not only to party bickering but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections </s>
<s> interesting evidence can be found in the results of the chamber of commerce elections which took place three weeks before national elections </s>
<s> as the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen the umcia was generally favored against the more progressive labor-based unfp </s>
<s> the newer party campaigned heavily while the older more confident party expected the moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years </s>
<s> the local istiqlal and umcia offices did not campaign and lost heavily </s>
<s> the chamber of commerce elections were of course an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections </s>
<s> the unfp learned that its urban organization which depends heavily on umt support was most effective </s>
<s> the istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete precise problems of internal politics </s>
<s> the overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken place </s>
<s> a second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections </s>
<s> although a somewhat technical subject it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated </s>
<s> furthermore the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results </s>
<s> the sine qua non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure </s>
<s> as the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections </s>
<s> the bulk of the preparation had of course proceeded under the supervision of the ministry of the interior whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics </s>
<s> apart from some areas of recurring trouble like bani mellal where inexperienced officials had been appointed there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process </s>
<s> centrally however the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage </s>
<s> the king decided to remove ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party council of government under his personal direction </s>
<s> although the monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance his action was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor </s>
<s> the new council was itself inescapably of political meaning which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any unfp members and the presence of several istiqlal leaders </s>
<s> since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the unfp </s>
<s> there were three major administrative tasks the fixing of electoral districts the registration of voters and the registration of candidates </s>
<s> the government was most anxious that there be a respectable response </s>
<s> periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials </s>
<s> the qualifications to vote were kept very simple </s>
<s> both men and women of twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification </s>
<s> there were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking </s>
<s> the police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens criminals and those punished for protectorate activities </s>
<s> unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future </s>
<s> some vocational training schools provide such training but the current need exceeds the facilities </s>
<s> current programs </s>
<s> the federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools </s>
<s> the initiative administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts </s>
<s> even the states remain primarily in an assisting role providing leadership and teacher training </s>
<s> federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure and the state or local districts must pay at least half </s>
<s> the state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it </s>
<s> throughout the history of the program state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the federal expenditures while local districts all together have spent more than either federal or state governments </s>
<s> the greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds </s>
<s> national defense considerations have been the major reason behind most federal training expenditures in recent decades </s>
<s> no comparable measures are available of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education training </s>
<s> there are a great number and variety of private commercial schools trade schools and technical schools </s>
<s> in addition many large corporations operate their own formal training programs </s>
<s> most skilled industrial workers nevertheless still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions </s>
<s> the national manpower council of columbia university has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have not been formally trained </s>
<s> there is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education </s>
<s> employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those without and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training </s>
<s> vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills </s>
<s> in most states trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools usually located in the larger cities </s>
<s> an important recent trend is the development of area vocational schools </s>
<s> for a number of years kentucky louisiana and several other states have been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties </s>
<s> these schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts </s>
<s> transportation may be provided from nearby school districts </s>
<s> courses are provided mainly for post high school day programs </s>
<s> but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend and evening extension courses also may be conducted </s>
<s> an extension of this program into the other distressed areas should be undertaken </s>
<s> relation to new industry </s>
<s> some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry </s>
<s> the major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a large number of semi-skilled machine operators </s>
<s> a prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees </s>
<s> the existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled </s>
<s> additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities staff and program are in being </s>
<s> thus besides the training provided to youth in school the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts </s>
<s> few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry </s>
<s> the opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant </s>
<s> local focus of programs </s>
<s> the major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands </s>
<s> this weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country </s>
<s> planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers </s>
<s> all the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs of estimating the growth of local jobs and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content </s>
<s> furthermore there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys </s>
<s> local jobs can be seen and counted while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical </s>
<s> while the u s department of labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning </s>
<s> the u s office of education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys </s>
<s> this procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment </s>
<s> elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills </s>
<s> no effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained </s>
<s> moreover the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary </s>
<s> there simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable </s>
<s> much of the available information comes not from the federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states </s>
<s> proposals </s>
<s> state and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities </s>
<s> there is a need for an expanded federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs </s>
<s> a related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided </s>
<s> there is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs even though they must pay tuition receive no subsistence payments and are not guaranteed a job </s>
<s> however there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training </s>
<s> again one major difficulty is the local focus </s>
<s> a training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community </s>
<s> if there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere many more workers can be expected to respond </s>
<s> another problem is who will pay for the training </s>
<s> local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training </s>
<s> programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it </s>
<s> even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it </s>
<s> state governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools but their focus is still on area job opportunities </s>
<s> only the federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs </s>
<s> if only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states </s>
<s> however if federal funds are used it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment </s>
<s> such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities </s>
<s> a further possibility is suggested by the example of the g i bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate </s>
<s> this probably would require some support for subsistence as well as for tuition but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a youth conservation corps </s>
<s> a program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor </s>
<s> instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training </s>
<s> such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located </s>
<s> this would heighten possibilities for part-time cooperative on-the-job and extension training </s>
<s> personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual </s>
<s> his aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training </s>
<s> but briefly the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences </s>
<s> then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance </s>
<s> but there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense </s>

<s> the advantages and disadvantages of these two types of charting bar charting and point and figure charting remain the subject of fairly good-natured litigation among their respective professional advocates with both methods enjoying in common one irrevocable merit </s>
<s> they are both trend-following methods </s>
<s> of course many more things are charted besides prices </s>
<s> the foregoing have been methods of charting prices but now let us look at some of the other indices that are customarily charted and which are looked to for their forecasting abilities </s>
<s> the quest for methods </s>
<s> the search for forecasting formulae is ceaseless </s>
<s> correlations have been worked up between the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price </s>
<s> the theory behind this is of course fundamentalist in character </s>
<s> as the number of reported freight car loadings increased this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity and consequently increased stock earnings implying fatter dividends and implying therefore increased stock market prices </s>
<s> we now know that things rarely ever work out in such cut-and-dried fashion and that car loadings while perhaps interesting enough are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn </s>
<s> it recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth a quest heavily invested in during the days of wooden ships </s>
<s> just as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who carry on the quest for the enchanting index </s>
<s> the quest offers careers </s>
<s> they are concerned with all things traded in securities bonds cocao coffee soybeans cotton tin oats etc </s>
<s> they plot the open interest curves rainfall curves and they even divide democratic congressmen by republican congressmen </s>
<s> all these things and countless more enter into their calculations and yet the enchanting index remains non-forthcoming </s>
<s> not at any rate in the fuller sense of the word </s>
<s> the markets are far too subtle and the last word in these endeavors will doubtless never be written for the enchanting index is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth </s>
<s> but whereas civilized men no longer pursue the fountain they never abandoned their pursuit of the enchanting index </s>
<s> we mentioned odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago </s>
<s> a stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange </s>
<s> this results in a separate record being made distinguishing these trades from the overall volume of trading </s>
<s> or to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders </s>
<s> figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers </s>
<s> odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their particular statistical recipe </s>
<s> they might for example plot it exactly as is or they might make ten day moving averages of it or longer moving averages or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales </s>
<s> the particular recipe is a matter of individual taste </s>
<s> the data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart usually of a popular stock average </s>
<s> towards the end of an intermediate or major rise while the top is forming on the price chart it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply </s>
<s> this warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top </s>
<s> similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle towards the end of an intermediate or major decline usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood </s>
<s> thus in the aggregate the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the bottoms notwithstanding occasional individual exceptions </s>
<s> and the converse at bottoms </s>
<s> obviously someone has to sell in order for someone to buy and vice versa </s>
<s> they initiate campaigns so to speak even if this initiation is diffused among them and their concerted action only psychologically organized </s>
<s> strong hands act </s>
<s> weak hands react </s>
<s> strong hands move first </s>
<s> when strong hands buy they are able to buy more and they do it even in the face of bearish news reports </s>
<s> they are able to sit more patiently with what they have bought </s>
<s> needless to say strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up at higher prices during the run-up phase of the campaign </s>
<s> certain badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive forces </s>
<s> try to imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose and the majority would make consistent profits </s>
<s> not before </s>
<s> membership in the echelons fluctuates too </s>
<s> the usefulness of this study and of configuration analysis as well declines in direct proportion to the dissemination of its use </s>
<s> diametric opposition must persist as to the future course of prices if there is to persist a market at all </s>
<s> and the few must win what the many lose for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all and is in fact unimaginable </s>
<s> there need be no squeamishness about admitting this </s>
<s> anyone still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what the minority loses </s>
<s> if you got too many people investing by this method their operations would begin to affect stock prices and thus throw the charts off </s>
<s> nevertheless all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible modes of expression if they lead to a market committment at all </s>
<s> in the final analysis then the user becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance notwithstanding any amount of forethought and calculation however elaborate </s>
<s> thus while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed it is commonplace for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed </s>
<s> though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse the possible conclusions remain but two </s>
<s> the hoaxes </s>
<s> the purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already in use so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that is to follow and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead </s>
<s> by and large what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates </s>
<s> nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity </s>
<s> during much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy </s>
<s> the tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident </s>
<s> it is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust </s>
<s> the rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some decline </s>
<s> in earlier business cycles when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to obtain </s>
<s> at this time however there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction </s>
<s> on the other hand in a more favorable vein general business activity should receive some stimulus from rising federal spending and the reduction in business inventories has probably run a good part of its course </s>
<s> the recovery will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit as well as by an expansion of government spending well sustained consumer spending and some rebuilding of business inventories </s>
<s> slight downward pressure </s>
<s> however as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great </s>
<s> it seems likely moreover that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage lending institutions interest rates on residential mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year although the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate eg easier downpayment and amortization terms </s>
<s> if the trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here we are likely to see additional steps by the federal reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit </s>
<s> certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility as well as an easier reserve position for the banking system </s>
<s> however the monetary authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow of gold as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive liquidity in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle </s>
<s> open market policy </s>
<s> one of the most intriguing questions is whether the recent departures of the federal reserve authorities from confining their open market operations to treasury bills will spread into longer-term government securities in the next few months </s>
<s> to the extent that the new administration has its wishes the federal reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of government securities and aggressively seek to force down long-term interest rates </s>
<s> however to the extent that the monetary authorities in their effort to ease credit in the next several months conduct their open market operations in longer-term government bonds they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces </s>
<s> my answer is in the negative because i believe that total capital demands during the sixties will continue to press against available supplies and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels </s>
<s> five basic forces </s>
<s> recent events in the general assembly of the united nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us and probably intensify for the foreseeable future </s>
<s> this makes it certain that federal expenditures for military preparedness and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years </s>
<s> we are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new african nations against the ruthless competition of the communist bloc </s>
<s> our efforts to overcome the lead of the russians in space are bound to mean accelerated federal spending </s>
<s> moreover it is likely that federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs will lead to rising federal spending in certain areas such as education housing medical aid and the like </s>
<s> there are serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising federal expenditures of which i take a dim view but it seems very likely to occur </s>
<s> during the sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping up in the rate of household formations which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building </s>
<s> accordingly the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the general economic prospects of the sixties </s>
<s> however the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated </s>
<s> with the expansion of family formation in the sixties a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated </s>
<s> this is an area in which there is still a large backlog of demand </s>
<s> here would be a powerful force for raising business activity </s>
<s> it seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the fifties </s>
<s> spurred by keen competition in our industrial system and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade </s>
<s> there is some clear-cut evidence of this </s>
<s> for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans for housing under the va home loan guaranty program seems to have largely exhausted itself </s>
<s> indeed the failure of home-building as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings may also signal in part that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an end </s>
<s> in a way we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of the frills which were accepted in the fifties </s>
<s> the huge backlog of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the war was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the war and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields </s>
<s> the consuming public has used up a good part of these liquid assets or they have been drained by the rising price level and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier </s>
<s> this is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the sixties </s>
<s> i am confident that it will but consumer spending in the sixties will not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized most of the fifties </s>
<s> markets should become more competitive as consumers become more selective </s>
<s> sixties capital requirements </s>
<s> accordingly during the sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the fifties and in the process to require enormous amounts of capital funds </s>
<s> the purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries </s>
<s> the model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny </s>
<s> the contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition and an exploration of some of its implications </s>
<s> for expository purposes this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages </s>
<s> a </s>
<s> the industry </s>
<s> the industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry producing a substantial share of gross national product </s>
<s> price competition is lacking </s>
<s> for the purposes of setting the product price the industry behaves as a single entity </s>
<s> in wage negotiations the industry bargains as a unit with a single union </s>
<s> b </s>
<s> the manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given </s>
<s> for the purposes of this discussion the problem of relative prices is encompassed in these two variables since gnp includes other prices </s>
<s> the form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price and vary directly with the level of aj </s>
<s> c </s>
<s> industry product price policy </s>
<s> the industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest </s>
<s> because of its importance and because the lack of price competition is well recognized the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases </s>
<s> thus if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate </s>
<s> in such circumstances it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate </s>
<s> since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises the profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated and is likely to remain well above the latter </s>
<s> the entry-limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition but unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy we might expect the public-limit price to approach the entry-limit price </s>
<s> the foreign-entry-limit price would be approached more rapidly since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign costs directly </s>
<s> the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things the passage of time the level of gnp and the size of the wage increase </s>
<s> we are abstracting from the fact of strikes here but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry </s>
<s> as a strike continues these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement </s>
<s> they become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail </s>
<s> thus the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase </s>
<s> notice however that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per se without an accompanying wage increase </s>
<s> similarly higher levels of gnp do not in themselves provide grounds for raising prices but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase </s>
<s> d </s>
<s> industry costs </s>
<s> the level of this average cost is determined by factor prices technology and so forth </s>
<s> as we have noted however we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate </s>
<s> e </s>
<s> union policies and collective bargaining issues </s>
<s> the single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate </s>
<s> the union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases but we abstract from these forces here </s>
<s> productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry much less to the union or to the public </s>
<s> disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity increase should be shared </s>
<s> the existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase in the basic wage rate </s>
<s> changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising and they constitute an argument for raising prices </s>
<s> however it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude </s>
<s> thus for non-negative changes in the basic wage rate the industry becomes the active wage-setter since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence </s>
<s> from this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model </s>
<s> it is this conclusion that we challenge </s>
<s> we do so by disproving the presumption on which it is based </s>
<s> several factors contributed to this change </s>
<s> the congress of vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow </s>
<s> thus the congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century </s>
<s> international law had to fit the conditions of europe and nothing that could not fit this system or the interests of the great european nations collectively could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense </s>
<s> essentially this imposed two conditions first international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive suspicious and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another </s>
<s> second it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared </s>
<s> in both respects international law was europeanized </s>
<s> it was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions </s>
<s> but there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world </s>
<s> thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller european states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere </s>
<s> a nation such as switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality </s>
<s> out of the question was the neutralization of asia and africa </s>
<s> of course it had always been of european origin in fact but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory </s>
<s> now with virtually every writer not only was the european origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of europe were to be imposed on others </s>
<s> the european customs on which international law was based were to become by force and fiat the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states </s>
<s> hall for example was quite explicit on this point when he said states outside european civilization must formally enter into the circle of law-governed countries </s>
<s> during the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the latin american writers though ineffectively just as the new nations of africa and asia protest them with more effect today </s>
<s> a number of other nineteenth-century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law of nations into international law </s>
<s> that is from aspects of a universal system of justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states </s>
<s> the difference is important for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among sovereigns this was by no means its exclusive domain </s>
<s> the law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens to foreigners and to each other in a conceptually unified system </s>
<s> the theory of international law which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in europe and america broke this unity and this universality </s>
<s> it lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations </s>
<s> no longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do </s>
<s> his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action </s>
<s> to appreciate this development we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy </s>
<s> national identification was not new but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout europe as new unifications occurred </s>
<s> national identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which incorporated this hegelian abstraction and saw law domestic and international simply as its formal reflection </s>
<s> a state the highest form of human organization in fact and theory could be subjected to law only by a manifestation of self-will or consent </s>
<s> he no longer sought to find the law </s>
<s> he made it </s>
<s> he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be </s>
<s> there was no law domestic or international except that willed by acknowledged by or consented to by states </s>
<s> hidden behind hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence </s>
<s> related to but distinguishable from nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another </s>
<s> increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions </s>
<s> the efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions </s>
<s> law became a conscious process something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms </s>
<s> particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed </s>
<s> the old way of doing things which depended on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations was no longer adequate to the task </s>
<s> codification was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation some changing and adjusting the older law much dealing with entirely new situations </s>
<s> the legislative mills have been grinding ever since and when its cumbersome processes were no longer adequate to the task a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another to the executive </s>
<s> whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law </s>
<s> indeed with developed positivism the separation of law from justice or from morality generally became quite specific </s>
<s> it is true that initially the task was to remove restrictions that it was thought inhibited the free flow of money goods and labor </s>
<s> but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy </s>
<s> however the sovereign was not hobbes absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of austin </s>
<s> it was too an optimistic philosophy and though it separated law from morality it was by no means an immoral or amoral one </s>
<s> man through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom was master of his destiny </s>
<s> the theory did not require though it unfortunately might acquire a hegelian mystique </s>
<s> it was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government </s>
<s> it was not opposed to either justice or morality </s>
<s> it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority </s>
<s> particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of western society </s>
<s> that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated </s>
<s> that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market </s>
<s> that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with </s>
<s> indeed contract was the dominant legal theme of the century the touchstone of the free society </s>
<s> government itself was based upon contract </s>
<s> trade was based on freedom of contract and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms </s>
<s> even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement </s>
<s> it is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract </s>
<s> in the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system </s>
<s> one result was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations </s>
<s> admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older law of nations and made dependent on the several national laws </s>
<s> the change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation and then largely in marginal situations </s>
<s> federal question jurisdiction </s>
<s> one purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the civil war amendments against state interference </s>
<s> serious difficulty arose with the advent of substantive due process </s>
<s> a flood of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of local government </s>
<s> such legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter </s>
<s> three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions against collection of state taxes </s>
<s> this saved for state adjudication in the first instance the two major areas where federal injunctions had been most obnoxious but other areas remained vulnerable </s>
<s> meanwhile the supreme court like congress showed misgivings concerning this aspect of government by injunction </s>
<s> whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability of adequate state remedies the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue </s>
<s> the classic case is railroad commission v pullman </s>
<s> the commission had issued an administrative order which was challenged as discriminatory against negroes </s>
<s> its enforcement was enjoined by a federal trial court </s>
<s> an alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether the offending order had in fact been authorized </s>
<s> but it is crucial that here unlike burford the trial court was ordered to retain the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the state-law question </s>
<s> temporary abstention ie postponement is one thing </s>
<s> refusal to adjudicate is another </s>
<s> the railroad claiming deprivation of property without due process of law sought injunctive relief </s>
<s> the court held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be obstructed </s>
<s> this in the name of equitable discretion </s>
<s> but they objected vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of congress </s>
<s> a most revealing recent case is textile workers union v lincoln mills </s>
<s> on its face this merely provides a federal forum </s>
<s> in short congressional power to grant federal-question authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that congress need not create or specify the right to be enforced </s>
<s> to avoid these constitutional difficulties mr justice frankfurter was prepared to read the taft-hartley provision as concerned with diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction </s>
<s> it would also leave intact the states traditional authority in the realm of contract law </s>
<s> if congress wants to displace the states from areas which they have customarily occupied let it do so knowingly and explicitly </s>
<s> and let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal judges </s>
<s> there is a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases </s>
<s> congress has not clearly defined the bounds between state and federal court competence </s>
<s> it has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a case-by-case basis </s>
<s> the same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in the fela certiorari cases in the administrative law area and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review </s>
<s> federal review of state decisions </s>
<s> with few exceptions congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to enforce rights arising under federal law </s>
<s> to put it differently state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right </s>
<s> to insure uniformity in the meaning of national law however state interpretations are subject to supreme court review </s>
<s> the result of course would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states </s>
<s> we consider here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial federal-state relationship </s>
<s> the first is that enforcement of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance </s>
<s> subject to certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials each level of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures </s>
<s> litigants who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure </s>
<s> a similar canon applies to those who press state claims in federal tribunals eg in diversity cases </s>
<s> in other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the pleader by state law </s>
<s> here as in the byrd case another element of state procedure was subsumed to federal judge-made law </s>
<s> terminiello v chicago involved a conviction for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance </s>
<s> the conduct in question was a speech </s>
<s> though the accused raised many other objections he did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings </s>
<s> that is he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right </s>
<s> there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities </s>
<s> to this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the committee report seems justified since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication if not the language of the statute </s>
<s> such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone </s>
<s> it would certainly violate the intention of congress as expressed in the committee report </s>
<s> and in at least one instance involving refund claims it might be contrary to another provision of the united states code </s>
<s> refund claims </s>
<s> a clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation </s>
<s> the leading case seaboard air line railway v united states held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor and it has been consistently followed </s>
<s> the court said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties one of them a stranger to the claim and to prevent traffic in claims particularly tenuous claims against the government </s>
<s> neither reason said the court applied to the case at hand </s>
<s> furthermore congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states </s>
<s> other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors corporate dissolutions transfers by descent or transfers by subrogation </s>
<s> a recent case in point is mitchell canneries v united states in which a claim against the government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership whose partners were former stockholders and then to another corporation formed by the partners </s>
<s> the anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the american corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the british corporation </s>
<s> the court nevertheless relied on the seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders of the two corporations were the same </s>
<s> in substance said the court there was no transfer of equitable title </s>
<s> proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be filed </s>
<s> if the succession is a matter of public record certificates of the secretaries of state or other public officials having custody of the documents will suffice </s>
<s> if the succession is not of record all documents relating to such succession properly certified are required </s>
<s> the former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation the latter to a contractual acquisition </s>
<s> the ruling would not however apply to an acquisition of assets for cash </s>
<s> the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization </s>
<s> these results appear sound </s>
<s> the cases have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed </s>
<s> in virtually every case the transferor corporation is liquidated and its former stockholders either own outright or have a continuing stock interest in the assets which gave rise to the tax </s>
<s> in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly remote </s>
<s> furthermore in a c reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger to which the statute is clearly inapplicable </s>
<s> if the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes </s>
<s> if such an unlikely transaction were to take place it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase followed by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary followed by liquidation </s>
<s> the successor corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims </s>
<s> other tax attributes of the transferor </s>
<s> there are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved </s>
<s> attributes similar to a loss carryover </s>
<s> there may be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items </s>
<s> for example suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted providing for carryover of excess profits credits </s>
<s> this carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover </s>
<s> it is an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income </s>
<s> it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects to have a high excess profits tax </s>
<s> actually there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover </s>
<s> probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax avoidance </s>

<s> reasons for selecting mail questionnaire method </s>
<s> as a result it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government </s>
<s> it was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature </s>
<s> it is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations </s>
<s> there is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents </s>
<s> a respondent may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question </s>
<s> there is also the question of whether the respondent based his answers on factual information and carefully considered judgment or whether his answers were casual guesses </s>
<s> the research team was very mindful of these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire </s>
<s> under the circumstances however the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point </s>
<s> in the preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered and the structure and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations </s>
<s> b </s>
<s> design of the questionnaire </s>
<s> it was hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did </s>
<s> the questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was optional </s>
<s> the questionnaire also stated that in any event all replies would be treated confidentially </s>
<s> c </s>
<s> preparation and pretest of the questionnaire </s>
<s> the research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months </s>
<s> several days after the companies had received the questionnaire members of the research team contacted the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees might have experienced in completing the questionnaire </s>
<s> this test resulted in further revisions of the questionnaire </s>
<s> the research team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of washington might not be typical of those throughout the country or that the results might be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made </s>
<s> accordingly another test of the questionaire was made </s>
<s> the method of compiling the aia and tr lists will be described later </s>
<s> ten days after the questionnaires were mailed follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do so at once </s>
<s> twenty-eight returns in all were received </s>
<s> the responses were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the respondent </s>
<s> d </s>
<s> compilation of mailing lists </s>
<s> the objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs </s>
<s> the firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind </s>
<s> three lists of companies were made and used in the study </s>
<s> the first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work </s>
<s> the primary consideration in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire with company officers </s>
<s> these names were secured from member companies by the association from the forty-four sources listed in appendix aj </s>
<s> where possible the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address </s>
<s> the forty-four lists supplied by the aia member companies were merged and duplicate names were eliminated </s>
<s> there was further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive </s>
<s> the third list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the thomas register </s>
<s> it was compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the aerospace industries association were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs </s>
<s> the fact that the aerospace industries association members whose lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs </s>
<s> the fact that companies on the aia lists were already participating in the defense program because of the manner of their selection </s>
<s> the fact that aia lists might not have been selected on a random basis </s>
<s> the control sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical listing of manufacturers in the thomas register </s>
<s> if the bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted </s>
<s> fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion </s>
<s> e </s>
<s> mailing the questionnaire </s>
<s> each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm </s>
<s> the questionnaires were mailed in seattle washington and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of idaho montana oregon and washington </s>
<s> airmail was used for the addresses outside the pacific northwest </s>
<s> each letter contained a postage-prepaid return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the pacific northwest and by airmail for those outside the pacific northwest </s>
<s> approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed a follow-up airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names </s>
<s> f </s>
<s> returns received </s>
<s> fifty-seven returns could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed </s>
<s> g </s>
<s> processing the returns </s>
<s> each questionnaire was audited for obvious mistakes and for comments and was identified by a serial number by the source list from which the company name was selected and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the postmark on the return envelope </s>
<s> all responses except comments were numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment </s>
<s> the codes were key-punched into ibm punch cards and verified </s>
<s> in order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate serial number of the respondent </s>
<s> the returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms </s>
<s> the second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the aia list with those from companies on the tr list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of the study </s>
<s> the methods and results of this comparative analysis are described in appendix aj </s>
<s> it was concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in or wishing to sell to defense programs </s>
<s> in the first place the two groups of firms when combined had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the aia list alone </s>
<s> the vast central valley of california is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world </s>
<s> by virtue of the legal responsibilities of the department of employment in the farm placement program we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces </s>
<s> it is not a pleasant or easy position but one we have endeavored to maintain </s>
<s> we have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose </s>
<s> inevitably one side was pleased and the other displeased regardless of how we ruled </s>
<s> often the displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other </s>
<s> we have consoled ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding </s>
<s> for a number of years there have been sporadic attempts in california to organize farm workers </s>
<s> these attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons </s>
<s> they were inadequately financed without experienced leadership and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole </s>
<s> this past year the pattern has been different the organizing program had the full support of the afl-cio which supplied staff and money to the awoc as well as moral support </s>
<s> leadership was experienced and skillful and financial resources were significant </s>
<s> regardless of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life </s>
<s> as a result of these changed conditions the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations has been much greater than in the past </s>
<s> by the very nature of the situation it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management </s>
<s> to date at least the strategy of the awoc has been selective </s>
<s> that is to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the state </s>
<s> primarily we became involved in these disputes because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program </s>
<s> normally because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the unemployment insurance code although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility </s>
<s> most of us remember and think of the wagner-peyser act in its historical sense as a major milestone in the development of public placement services </s>
<s> infrequently do we think of it as a living continuing operating control over the system </s>
<s> however when labor disputes arise its provisions come clearly into play </s>
<s> the state of california accepts the provisions of the wagner-peyser act and will observe and comply with the requirements of that act </s>
<s> with respect to labor disputes the wagner-peyser act states only </s>
<s> in carrying out the provisions of this act the secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they are referred to employment </s>
<s> other provisions of the act empower the secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions and he has done so </s>
<s> referrals in labor dispute situations </s>
<s> in analyzing this regulation let us take the last sentence first </s>
<s> it permits referrals under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute </s>
<s> assume for example a situation where a farm has a packing shed and fields </s>
<s> the packing shed workers go on strike </s>
<s> there is no dispute involving fieldwork </s>
<s> so far no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision </s>
<s> it is the first part of the regulation that is currently at issue </s>
<s> employer representatives have contended that the secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition on the grounds that the wagner-peyser act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists </s>
<s> into court </s>
<s> the matter got into the courts this way one of the early strikes called by the awoc was at the digiorgio pear orchards in yuba county </s>
<s> we found that a labor dispute existed and that the workers had left their jobs which were then vacant because of the dispute </s>
<s> the court issued a temporary restraining order directing us to resume referrals </s>
<s> we of course obeyed the court order </s>
<s> however the federal court held that since the state had accepted the provisions of the wagner-peyser act into its own code and presumably therefore also the regulations it was now a state matter </s>
<s> it accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction whereupon the california superior court made the restraining order permanent </s>
<s> under that order we have continued referring workers to the ranch </s>
<s> a similar case arose at the bowers ranch in butte county and the superior court of that county issued similar restraining orders </s>
<s> i cannot accept that view either as a lawyer or as an administrator </s>
<s> legal considerations </s>
<s> first let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved </s>
<s> it is an accepted juridical principle in california that a superior court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent </s>
<s> it is conclusive unless appealed only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard </s>
<s> it is not binding upon another superior court which could rule to the contrary </s>
<s> in that event we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation of the matter and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrown in other superior courts </s>
<s> i believe i am in good company in this view </s>
<s> the attorney general of california concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the district court of appeal </s>
<s> the attorney general of the united states in considering the power of the secretary to issue similar regulations under the wagner-peyser act relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers has rendered an opinion sustaining his authority </s>
<s> next let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals </s>
<s> there is far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in midair </s>
<s> the ramifications of the issue are enormous </s>
<s> a decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as strikebreakers </s>
<s> the public interest is so dominant in such an issue that i cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two superior courts in the state </s>
<s> it is an issue which may well reach the supreme court of the united states before judicial finality is achieved </s>
<s> as an administrator i cannot place the employment service in california in jeopardy of being out of compliance with the federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of appeal open to me </s>
<s> to have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in superior court in my opinion would have placed us clearly out of compliance with the wagner-peyser act and would have immediately opened the way for the secretary of labor were he so inclined to notify the governor of such noncompliance set a date for hearing and issue his finding </s>
<s> because of the uncertainty of this definition i solicited the interpretation of the secretary of labor </s>
<s> he has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the proper one </s>
<s> that is that if wages for example is the only issue in a labor dispute and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute we may continue to make referrals </s>
<s> martin and stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them </s>
<s> after they have developed concepts they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects </s>
<s> they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely </s>
<s> the ability to think seems to increase consistently with age </s>
<s> one experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years </s>
<s> that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events </s>
<s> and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden </s>
<s> emotional characteristics </s>
<s> how a child feels about himself about other people and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics </s>
<s> a considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not likely to do well in school subjects </s>
<s> however the teacher who understands the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential in helping pupils gain confidence security and satisfaction </s>
<s> the following generalizations about the emotional characteristics of elementary-school children may be helpful </s>
<s> ridiculing a child for being afraid or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem </s>
<s> more effective solutions include explanations the example of another child or conditioning by associating the feared object place or person with something pleasant </s>
<s> children need help in learning to control their emotions </s>
<s> the young child learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums screaming kicking and hitting will not get him what he wants </s>
<s> the older child learns that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers and therefore makes a real effort to control his emotions </s>
<s> children differ widely in their emotional responses </s>
<s> among infants the patterns of emotional responses are similar </s>
<s> as the influence of learning and environment are felt emotional behavior becomes individualized </s>
<s> social characteristics </s>
<s> although no national norms exist for the social development of children the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed by children at various age levels </s>
<s> the following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school children </s>
<s> the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals struggling to meet their developmental needs and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which they hold membership </s>
<s> during early childhood children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children </s>
<s> after they have been in school a few years their interest in playmates of their own age increases and their interest in adults decreases </s>
<s> the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family gatherings now considers it a bore </s>
<s> in late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase </s>
<s> the group sets the styles in clothing the kind of play engaged in and the ideals of right and wrong behavior </s>
<s> in early childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older who can do the things he likes to do </s>
<s> such factors as sex intelligence and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time </s>
<s> in later childhood an interest in team games replaces individual play </s>
<s> loyalty to the group a feeling of superiority over those who are not members and unwillingness to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits </s>
<s> during early childhood boys tease and bully on the average more than girls </s>
<s> those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activities more than do well-adjusted children </s>
<s> during late childhood boys like to tease jostle and talk smart to girls </s>
<s> girls who are more mature than boys frown upon the youthful antics of boys of their own age </s>
<s> by the time pupils reach the sixth grade their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed </s>
<s> they exhibit a keen interest in social political and economic problems but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work </s>
<s> between the ages of two and four years negativism or resistance to adult authority is noticeable </s>
<s> after the fourth year it begins to decline </s>
<s> however as we have seen in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers </s>
<s> the elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups </s>
<s> the child in the primary grades can play harmoniously with one companion but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger </s>
<s> in the middle grades however he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader helping to make plans and carry on group activities and setting up rules governing the enterprise </s>
<s> why the teacher should study the individual pupil </s>
<s> much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program </s>
<s> some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit </s>
<s> others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom </s>
<s> these children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand </s>
<s> many school systems now employ school psychologists and child guidance specialists </s>
<s> these specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom and by providing clinical services for severely maladjusted children </s>
<s> it is the classroom teacher however who has daily contacts with pupils and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice </s>
<s> indeed a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the elementary-school teacher rather than merely an additional chore </s>
<s> teachers and administrators in many elementary schools have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals </s>
<s> what they should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success and that they still must be treated as individuals </s>
<s> although the teacher must be concerned with maintaining standards he must also be concerned about understanding differences in ability background and experience </s>
<s> factors that inhibit learning and lead to maladjustment </s>
<s> studies conducted in various sections of the united states indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted emotionally and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects </s>
<s> it is apparent therefore that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children </s>
<s> when a child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning insecurity unhappiness and other forms of maladjustment frequently follow </s>
<s> these maladjustments in turn inhibit learning and a vicious cycle is completed </s>
<s> it is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy or that the child who lacks interest in school who dislikes the teacher or who is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent </s>
<s> the causes of retardation and maladjustment may be found in physical factors such as defective speech or hearing impaired vision faulty motor coordination a frail constitution chronic disease malnutrition and glandular malfunctioning </s>
<s> they may be caused by poor health habits such as faulty eating and sleeping habits </s>
<s> they may be related to mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain types of school work </s>
<s> the curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others </s>
<s> teaching methods learning materials and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to maladjustments for some children </s>
<s> unwholesome family relations broken homes and undesirable community influences may also be contributing factors </s>
<s> this is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children </s>
<s> moreover these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner </s>
<s> a vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading disability for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading </s>
<s> an impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school </s>
<s> at any rate the teacher who recognizes common causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement failure and maladjustment </s>
<s> sources of information about children </s>
<s> successful teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment </s>
<s> the classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist </s>
<s> he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information needed about each child in his classroom </s>
<s> he can be expected however to examine and interpret the information already available </s>
<s> to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children </s>
<s> and to utilize opportunities arising in connection with regular classroom activities for gaining a better understanding of his pupils </s>
<s> this section deals with some of the sources of information that can be tapped by the classroom teacher </s>
<s> cumulative records </s>
<s> most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils </s>
<s> these records when systematically maintained provide much information about the children which the teacher can use in guidance instruction grouping and reporting to parents </s>
<s> each teacher has in his classroom a metal file equipped with a lock which is used to store cumulative record folders </s>
<s> during summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the principal </s>
<s> only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records </s>
<s> each new teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date </s>
<s> some school systems provide written instructions to principals and teachers designating when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be summarized and used </s>
<s> the summary report which was prepared for this conference indicates first that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing </s>
<s> second that both actual and pending desegregation is with few exceptions the product or result of court order </s>
<s> the report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow </s>
<s> but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition </s>
<s> desegregation and court order </s>
<s> first kentucky </s>
<s> elementary school desegregation came to owen and union counties which already had high school desegregation </s>
<s> in maryland the harford county board of education had prepared a desegregation plan which the court approved but which a plaintiff had challenged </s>
<s> thus county school board and federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation </s>
<s> additional school desegregation in tennessee resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel </s>
<s> similarly further desegregation may come from suits pending in three tennessee cities chattanooga knoxville and memphis </s>
<s> in west virginia the number of white and negro children attending the same school has increased almost twofold </s>
<s> there are no court decisions here </s>
<s> as in maryland a district court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in delaware </s>
<s> as a result of the state board of education plan negro children entered heretofore white elementary schools in five districts </s>
<s> the third circuit court of appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan </s>
<s> in virginia court orders led to desegregation in charlottesville and floyd counties </s>
<s> desegregation in pulaski county is pending because of court order although date of admission is not yet determined </s>
<s> negro parents have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in alexandria arlington fairfax and warren counties </s>
<s> desegregation can also result from additional suits brought by negro plaintiffs against school boards in newport news fairfax county arlington county and norfolk </s>
<s> this recapitulation makes it clear that school desegregation continues including the old dominion state in spite of its stern resistance </s>
<s> the record is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court order </s>
<s> before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this regional conference i wish to note a small item in the summary report as it refers to the district of columbia </s>
<s> i see no real prospects for an all-negro school population </s>
<s> nearby foggy bottom is ousting negroes </s>
<s> in fact short of fleeing to warrenton virginia or rockville maryland white people may have to live with negroes </s>
<s> problems to solve </s>
<s> from the summary report before us at this conference a number of problems are apparent </s>
<s> they vex us and perplex us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems </s>
<s> it is slow </s>
<s> i believe we all want more schools where white and negro together can and do attend </s>
<s> i believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color </s>
<s> in general members of nairo would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence zone </s>
<s> how to achieve this objective is a problem but we are not divided on what we want </s>
<s> it may be county school board or state school board action as well as that of municipal school boards </s>
<s> this is a problem and i believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and effect a plan of desegregation </s>
<s> not simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but a continuing program that also promotes integration that encourages the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or negro but as human beings </s>
<s> again the problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education </s>
<s> not whether it should be done </s>
<s> this is a problem but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence </s>
<s> now the issues </s>
<s> if we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively united fashion then there are twice as many issues which i judge sharply divide us intergroup relations practitioners and lay people </s>
<s> pupil assignment </s>
<s> on the basis of pupil assignment criteria judge albert bryan has assigned negro children to formerly white schools in arlington and alexandria virginia </s>
<s> teacher assignment in order to desegregate </s>
<s> we can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation </s>
<s> the plaintiff in school desegregation cases </s>
<s> the earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation </s>
<s> in each instance the plaintiff was a private citizen </s>
<s> in thousands of school districts indeed in the entire state of mississippi no plaintiff has come forth </s>
<s> and i have established that the action of municipal county or state school boards or boards of education is small infinitesimally small in comparison with the number of districts </s>
<s> this is an issue for it divides people rather sharply </s>
<s> withholding of funds to schools that deny children on account of race </s>
<s> this is softer than earlier powell amendments which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts </s>
<s> there is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause softened though it be on the grounds that federal aid is so necessary to the public schools </s>
<s> the federal funds limitation enlists the support of many the opposition of quite a few </s>
<s> required public education </s>
<s> even if we marshal substantial agreement behind mandatory public education we likely cannot expect that all the states will enact the legislation </s>
<s> federal responsibility for education of the citizens </s>
<s> nearly half the children still receive no education </s>
<s> the next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers </s>
<s> on the whole it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way </s>
<s> seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn </s>
<s> a hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth </s>
<s> in situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education </s>
<s> the few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers and such issues are not issues of educational policy </s>
<s> in general it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society </s>
<s> there have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy </s>
<s> if there were more such cases it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers favor their own social classes </s>
<s> there is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged </s>
<s> this is the issue of segregated schools in the south </s>
<s> in this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than social-class groups </s>
<s> thus the white middle and lower classes are arrayed against the negro middle and lower classes </s>
<s> this conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white lower-class people </s>
<s> if this happens there may be some class conflict in the south with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position </s>
<s> the educational profession </s>
<s> the members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy their position being strongest in the universities </s>
<s> they are mostly upper-middle- and lower-middle-class people with a few in the upper class </s>
<s> in a society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens these social values it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society </s>
<s> there is no problem here </s>
<s> the problem arises if it does arise when the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence but which bears some relation to the social structure </s>
<s> one upward-mobile teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb while another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations at home and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment </s>
<s> one social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families </s>
<s> their own experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers </s>
<s> while this influence is a complex matter depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth </s>
<s> teachers who have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them </s>
<s> that is they are likely to favor a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value </s>
<s> there are several causes for this one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training </s>
<s> but another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social advancement </s>
<s> their experience is quite in contrast with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born parents who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum </s>
<s> educational policies are formed by several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in the public interest </s>
<s> legislators are one such group and state legislators have major responsibility for educational legislation </s>
<s> they generally vote so as to serve their own constituency and if the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class they might be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests in education </s>
<s> however there are relatively few such political constituencies and as has been pointed out there is seldom a clear-cut distinction between the educational interests of one social class and those of another </s>
<s> another public interest group is the commission of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations </s>
<s> generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society as they conceive it </s>
<s> nevertheless their conclusions and recommendations cannot please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view </s>
<s> both commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people who attempted to act in the public interest </s>
<s> an example of a more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the commission on the financing of higher education sponsored by the association of american universities and supported by the rockefeller foundation and the carnegie corporation </s>
<s> this commission recommended against the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities and against a broad program of government-supported scholarships </s>
<s> which recommended a federal government scholarship program </s>
<s> furthermore the commission set up the council for financial aid to education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education </s>
<s> thus the commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education </s>
<s> then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs experiments and demonstrations </s>
<s> these people are practically always upper- or upper-middle-class persons who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society </s>
<s> these have an upper-middle-class leadership and a middle-class membership with rare exceptions where working-class parents are active in local p-ta matters </s>
<s> like the other policy-making groups these are middle class in their educational attitudes and they attempt to act in the general public interest as they see it </s>
<s> in general it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the interests of the society as a whole </s>
<s> they are predominantly middle- and upper-class people and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes </s>
<s> they may be unaware of the existence of lower-class values and consequently fail to take them into account </s>
<s> but there is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education </s>
<s> they think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society </s>
<s> attempts to influence social structure through education </s>
<s> educational policy in the united states has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity </s>
<s> in so far as this goal is achieved the society becomes more fluid artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced and people at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society </s>
<s> on the other hand there is a counterbalancing purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children </s>
<s> this leads to efforts at exclusiveness through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification in the schools </s>
<s> both of these purposes exist side by side without much overt conflict under present conditions </s>
<s> maximizing economic and cultural opportunity </s>
<s> the broad expansion of free education results both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promoting fluidity within the social structure </s>
<s> fifty years ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an example of this movement </s>
<s> during the past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities state colleges and community colleges </s>
<s> the reaffirmation of american faith in the comprehensive high school as expressed in the conant study is another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of maximizing opportunity through the equalizing of educational opportunity </s>
<s> meanwhile the private colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds </s>
<s> the gains in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions </s>
<s> unfortunately however and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues </s>
<s> and this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service </s>
<s> one such disagreement which will receive attention in this next chapter concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination must be made directly proportional to marginal costs or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs </s>
<s> here the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma </s>
<s> two major types of fully distributed cost analysis </s>
<s> the double-step type </s>
<s> for more explicit expositions one must distinguish different types of analyses </s>
<s> by all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution </s>
<s> since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the interstate commerce commission has estimated out-of-pocket costs and apportioned residue costs </s>
<s> suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is questionable </s>
<s> but in any event full credit should be given to the cost section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses namely that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service </s>
<s> and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination </s>
<s> the single-step type </s>
<s> instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables </s>
<s> as already noted in an earlier paragraph the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service such as residential commercial industrial power street lighting etc </s>
<s> high-tension industrial power service for example would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the low-tension distribution lines </s>
<s> but the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all or nearly all classes of customers </s>
<s> and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates </s>
<s> the general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an electric-utility cost analysis </s>
<s> but before turning to this example we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis both of which belong to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type </s>
<s> other services will show different rates of return some probably much lower and some higher </s>
<s> but the practice is likely to be misleading since it may seem to support a conclusion that as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating expenses plus some return on capital investment however low the rates of charge for this service are compensatory </s>
<s> needless to say any such inference would be quite unwarranted </s>
<s> for the reason just suggested i shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following simplified example </s>
<s> three-part analysis of the costs of an electric utility business </s>
<s> in order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant </s>
<s> let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service all of which is supplied at the same voltage phase etc to residential commercial and industrial customers </s>
<s> since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple </s>
<s> indeed that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption </s>
<s> in fact however the problem is not so simple </s>
<s> a recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required </s>
<s> if this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart in the actual rates of charge for service as it actually does have in some rates there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service </s>
<s> but our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs </s>
<s> let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative purposes </s>
<s> costs actually vary in much more complex ways </s>
<s> the customer costs </s>
<s> these are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless or almost regardless of power consumption </s>
<s> included as a minimum are the costs of metering and billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in taking on another consumer </s>
<s> the preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist </s>
<s> like primitive numbers in mathematics the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth </s>
<s> it has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation </s>
<s> the simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned </s>
<s> for if the small group notion involves the implicit claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic or subatomic proportions the philosopher needs to know the extent to which such entities are valid </s>
<s> the mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation </s>
<s> a parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically formed </s>
<s> philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially viable categories </s>
<s> this involves a sifting of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement </s>
<s> the purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is not to tyrannize but to clarify the principles of social science </s>
<s> it is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise to sociology since the former is a logical rational discipline where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical </s>
<s> such a position entails the negation of philosophy in its platonic form as something soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences </s>
<s> but contrary to whitehead philosophy is not a synonym for plato </s>
<s> the uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to any approach that does not descend to pure sensationalism </s>
<s> however when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences to dictate the conditions of empirical research it becomes formal metaphysics </s>
<s> shaping the contours of life to fit the needs of legends </s>
<s> the notion of philosophy as queen bee may fit well with authoritarian modes of political ideology but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial notion of philosophy is the frustration and flagellation of the social sciences </s>
<s> metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with nature as it was in antiquity </s>
<s> science is mocked for wishing to know nothing of nothing in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense of men </s>
<s> it is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality by distinguishing between description and prescription </s>
<s> it is simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century </s>
<s> it is a commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past philosophic hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable methodological criteria they move away from philosophy as such </s>
<s> what is left to traditional systems of philosophy is in effect only the history of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough to abide by the canons of scientific method </s>
<s> in this situation philosophy has survived by separating itself from metaphysics by showing the ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions </s>
<s> the relinquishing by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble sorts </s>
<s> in the new situation philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical sciences a reservoir of logical relations that can be used in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value </s>
<s> beyond this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry but within its potential domain of relevance </s>
<s> in this connection it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science were exploited </s>
<s> likewise kant formulated the nebular hypothesis according to which the solar system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by laplace in his systeme du monde </s>
<s> but the forceful presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a monumental task </s>
<s> however modesty and triviality are different qualities </s>
<s> philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences evolve </s>
<s> the ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a more durable sort of drama </s>
<s> by clarifying fundamental premises in the social sciences and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands of each new scientific discipline philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding </s>
<s> philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed </s>
<s> the dissection of scientific theory the examination of a theory from the vantage-points of language epistemology and ethics is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge no less so because of its removal from empirical research </s>
<s> the realm of science whatever the degree of precision in formulations covers the range of prediction and explanation </s>
<s> for some forms of philosophy this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical superiority of the latter </s>
<s> this is simply a confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to look virtuous </s>
<s> in this philosophy and science share a common goal </s>
<s> the hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument </s>
<s> for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between mysticism and science </s>
<s> the mystification of metaphysical systems does not imply the demise of philosophy only the close of a philosophic age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical </s>
<s> the tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize private intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science religion and ideology </s>
<s> philosophic systems by the very nature of their completeness are overthrown by rival systems </s>
<s> in addition to the incompleteness of science and the completeness of metaphysics they differ in that science is essentially descriptive while philosophy in its inherited forms tends to be goal-oriented teleological and prescriptive </s>
<s> the threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour is not subject to objective analysis has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against the sociology of knowledge since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable than social behaviour </s>
<s> when dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or better the role of philosophy in assisting research on the social sources of ideas one has to become necessarily selective </s>
<s> certain features we have touched upon philosophy as a logical deductive system from which a social science methodology can be built up </s>
<s> philosophic analysis of the assumptions and presumptions of the social sciences </s>
<s> and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological investigations </s>
<s> the objection will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in the social sciences </s>
<s> i think it must be said that contrary to metaphysical insistence these are questions so framed as to defy either empirical exploration or rational solutions </s>
<s> such pseudo-questions assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving undefined universals </s>
<s> social theory has no more right to expect results from meaningless questions than physics has the right to expect a theological solution to the wave-particle controversy </s>
<s> it is not that such questions are not asked </s>
<s> it is rather that introducing them into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for certainty </s>
<s> an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either replaces or reshapes </s>
<s> to raise the added objection that men require certainty on psychological grounds answers to ultimate questions having an irrational rather than scientific basis is in a real sense to undermine the objection itself </s>
<s> for what concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational ie for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and irrational </s>
<s> a philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence in the shortcomings of men an impatience with partial tentative solutions </s>
<s> men have always lived in a tentative world and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary </s>
<s> uncertainty overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise information about the world </s>
<s> without such uncertainty we are left with a set of dogmas and myths </s>
<s> the functional interplay of philosophy and science should as a minimum guarantee a meaningful option to myth-making </s>
<s> a degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition for the growth of science </s>
<s> but neither was the statement empirical for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard </s>
<s> to find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery </s>
<s> it appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only </s>
<s> this is the course the positivists took </s>
<s> they explained value judgments by explaining them away </s>
<s> now i do not think their view will do </s>
<s> but before discussing it i should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case </s>
<s> it has been said of john stuart mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out </s>
<s> this theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind and this i will do my best to supply </s>
<s> i shall argue that we do mean to do just that </s>
<s> let us work through an example and the simpler and commoner the better </s>
<s> there is perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain is bad </s>
<s> let us take a set of circumstances in which i happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which i think every one of us might naturally make such a statement </s>
<s> we come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in common use </s>
<s> there are signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger pain and fear it has all but eaten off its own leg </s>
<s> the attempt failed the animal is now dead </s>
<s> the positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion </s>
<s> consider what follows from the positivist view </s>
<s> on that view nothing good or bad happened in the case until i came on the scene and made my remark </s>
<s> for what i express in my remark is something going on in me at the time and that of course did not exist until i did come on the scene </s>
<s> the pain of the rabbit was not itself bad </s>
<s> nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured </s>
<s> badness in the only sense in which it is involved at all waited for its appearance till i came and looked and felt </s>
<s> now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows </s>
<s> let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered </s>
<s> clearly not </s>
<s> if so then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only </s>
<s> we are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it </s>
<s> the first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference </s>
<s> it removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this whereas on positivist grounds it should be </s>
<s> the second argument applies the method in the reverse way </s>
<s> it ideally removes the past event and shows that this would render false what we mean to say whereas on positivist grounds it should not </s>
<s> let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all but that we mistakenly believe it did and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing </s>
<s> on the positivist theory everything i sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second </s>
<s> in the only sense in which badness is involved at all whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling and that feeling is still there </s>
<s> clearly it is not </s>
<s> if anyone asked us after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all we should say that it made all the difference in the world that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there that if this had not occurred there was nothing left to be bad and that our assertion was in that case mistaken </s>
<s> the suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering seems to me merely frivolous </s>
<s> on the theory before us such relief would be groundless for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about </s>
<s> the positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition </s>
<s> so far as i can see there is only one way out for the positivist </s>
<s> he holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval </s>
<s> and there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself </s>
<s> the pain in itself was neutral </s>
<s> but unfortunately the rabbit on no grounds at all took up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the first time and in the only intelligible sense bad </s>
<s> this way of escape is theoretically possible but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not so far as i know been urged by positivists it is perhaps best not to spend time over it </s>
<s> i come now to a third argument which again is very simple </s>
<s> when we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing we presumably make it with some feeling </s>
<s> the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling </s>
<s> but suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again </s>
<s> and suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded </s>
<s> the pathetic evidence is no longer before us </s>
<s> and we are now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling is as we say quite dead </s>
<s> in these circumstances since what was expressed by the remark when first made is on the theory before us simply absent the remark now expresses nothing </s>
<s> and this seems to me untrue </s>
<s> when we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before we should certainly answer yes </s>
<s> we should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time but that it was the same point we were making </s>
<s> and if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express </s>
<s> i come now to a fourth consideration </s>
<s> we all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not </s>
<s> but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense </s>
<s> broad and ross have lately contended that this fitness is one of the main facts of ethics and i suspect they are right </s>
<s> but that is not exactly my point </s>
<s> my point is this whether there is such fitness or not we all assume that there is and if we do we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do </s>
<s> let me illustrate </s>
<s> in his novel the house of the dead dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a siberian prison camp </s>
<s> most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting </s>
<s> if we were asked why we thought so we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting </s>
<s> now on the subjectivist view this answer is ruled out </s>
<s> for before someone takes up an attitude toward death suffering or their infliction they have no moral quality at all </s>
<s> there is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting </s>
<s> they are in themselves neutral and so far as they get a moral quality they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker </s>
<s> in such a case any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point </s>
<s> indeed we are forced to go much farther </s>
<s> if goodness and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line </s>
<s> to greet them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad </s>
<s> it would needlessly bring badness into the world </s>
<s> and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright </s>
<s> on the other hand to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good </s>
<s> it would bring goodness into the world </s>
<s> the injured german veteran was a former miner twenty-four years old who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head </s>
<s> this resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also </s>
<s> psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images a condition in which for example one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence </s>
<s> we do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself </s>
<s> the underlying assumption of course is that only sight and touch enable us in any precise and fully dependable way to locate objects in space beyond us the other senses being decidedly inferior if not totally inadequate in this regard </s>
<s> this is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel </s>
<s> therefore if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary </s>
<s> we shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation </s>
<s> the answer the authors give to it therefore is of supreme importance </s>
<s> the authors insist however that these abnormalities in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight </s>
<s> and he could tell simply by the feel of it whether it was made of wood iron cloth rubber and so on </s>
<s> and he could recognize by touch alone articles which he had handled immediately before even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him </s>
<s> that is he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was </s>
<s> because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight the patient had to train himself for a new line of work that of a portfolio-maker an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour </s>
<s> then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand </s>
<s> he could not see objects as unified self-contained and organized figures as a person does with normal vision </s>
<s> the meaning of this as we shall see is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects </s>
<s> and therefore he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again </s>
<s> at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether </s>
<s> but by the tracing procedure he could in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner find the unseen form </s>
<s> could piece as it were the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned out to be </s>
<s> if however the figure to be discerned were complicated composed of several interlocking subfigures and so on even the tracing process failed him and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts </s>
<s> the patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at all </s>
<s> and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate him </s>
<s> after a conversation with another man he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like </s>
<s> nor could he call up memory-pictures of close friends or relatives </s>
<s> in short both his own declarations and his figural blindness when he looked at objects seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all </s>
<s> he was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape already learned and held in visual memory as persons of normal vision do </s>
<s> he could not recognize it </s>
<s> he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at all </s>
<s> therefore his only recourse was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object </s>
<s> and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure </s>
<s> then he might finally recognize it apparently by combining the visual blot actually being seen with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements </s>
<s> this would mean it can readily be seen that again for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery </s>
<s> as one would surmise the procedure however could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference </s>
<s> dice for example he inferred from black dots on a white surface </s>
<s> he evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects but their size and the dots gave them away </s>

<s> if the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually then it would seem the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations at least in regard to two dimensions and as we shall see even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by the authors </s>
<s> quite naturally they make the investigation first by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at all and then later by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to </s>
<s> when the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all the following striking results occurred </s>
<s> a schematic abstract treatment of men and animals by intent rose only in the late eighth century </s>
<s> to speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment </s>
<s> at the least however one may conclude that geometric potters sensed a logical order </s>
<s> their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the homeric epics and the hexameter line </s>
<s> their world again was a still simple traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life </s>
<s> and perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure </s>
<s> throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm severe serenity displays itself </s>
<s> in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction but the best of the geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the greek world </s>
<s> geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough detailed study which it deserves partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations as at argos are only now coming to light </s>
<s> the general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree </s>
<s> in this process the minoan-mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected </s>
<s> but all too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took place in the early first millennium </s>
<s> attica though important was not the only teacher of this age </s>
<s> imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable </s>
<s> the potters of the aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland and in greece itself argive corinthian attic boeotian and other geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks </s>
<s> these local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half </s>
<s> the same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the dark ages from linguistic distribution and from the survivals of early social political and religious patterns into later ages </s>
<s> on these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad </s>
<s> everywhere within the common pattern however one finds local diversity </s>
<s> greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized and plagued by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors </s>
<s> further we cannot go for the dark ages deserve their name </s>
<s> many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure </s>
<s> what we have seen in this chapter we have seen only dimly and yet the results however general are worth the search </s>
<s> these are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the hellenic outlook independent of outside forces </s>
<s> if we could see more deeply we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period </s>
<s> the historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding </s>
<s> throughout the dark ages it is clear the greek world had been developing slowly but consistently </s>
<s> the pace could now be accelerated for the inhabitants of the aegean stood on firm ground </s>
<s> the first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the aegean world </s>
<s> but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change </s>
<s> for this period as for earlier centuries pottery remains the most secure source </s>
<s> the ceramic material of the age is more abundant more diversified and more indicative of the hopes and fears of its makers who begin to show scenes of human life and death </s>
<s> figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in greece </s>
<s> objects in gold ivory and bronze grow more numerous </s>
<s> since writing was practiced in the aegean before the end of the century we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful </s>
<s> the dipylon geometric pottery of athens and the iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of greek civilization </s>
<s> but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending </s>
<s> greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution in which the developed qualities of the hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth </s>
<s> the era however is janus-faced </s>
<s> while many tokens point forward the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns of the dark ages </s>
<s> the dominant pottery of the century was geometric </s>
<s> political organization revolved about the basileis </s>
<s> trade was just beginning to expand </s>
<s> the gods who protected the greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress </s>
<s> the modern student who knows what was to come next is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century </s>
<s> not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis </s>
<s> many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas </s>
<s> the poet of the iliad deliberately archaized </s>
<s> although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of greek civilization </s>
<s> on this principle of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture architecture society and politics </s>
<s> for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself </s>
<s> we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the east as we consider ripe geometric pottery the epic and the myth and the religious evolution of early greece </s>
<s> the important point however is that these magnificent achievements unlike those of later decades were only incidentally influenced by oriental models </s>
<s> the antecedents of dipylon vases and of the iliad lie in the aegean past </s>
<s> dipylon pottery </s>
<s> the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called ripe geometric </s>
<s> the severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years the strong geometric style of the late ninth century display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying geometric pottery </s>
<s> but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance </s>
<s> the vases which resulted had different shapes far more complex decoration and a larger sense of style </s>
<s> beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines </s>
<s> in earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos </s>
<s> they had had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses </s>
<s> the potters in particular had virtually eschewed freehand drawing elaborate motifs and the curving lines of nature while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe </s>
<s> in their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of greek civilization at first hesitantly in protogeometric work and then more confidently in the initial stages of the geometric style </s>
<s> it was time to take bigger steps to venture on experiments </s>
<s> ripe geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited </s>
<s> in these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress </s>
<s> to the ancestral lore however new materials were added </s>
<s> painters left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color </s>
<s> instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep </s>
<s> the rows of animals and birds in particular suggest awareness of oriental animal friezes transmitted perhaps via syrian silver bowls and textiles but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless greek </s>
<s> though the spread of this type of decoration in the aegean has not yet been precisely determined it seems to appear first in the cyclades which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century </s>
<s> as the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased the local variations within a common style became more evident </s>
<s> cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and when he could not show the hide arrested him </s>
<s> thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction he later released him </s>
<s> even while suffering the trip to his home cook swore to moore and lane that he would kill the indian </s>
<s> three weeks later following his recovery armed with a writ issued by the catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney cook and russell rode to arrest martinez </s>
<s> arriving at daybreak they found julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender </s>
<s> instead he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him cook reported </s>
<s> general manager pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away and try to have a few punished </s>
<s> while talking with julian m beall francisco archuleta and juan marcus appeared both heavily armed and after watching the house for a while rode away </s>
<s> it was nearly sundown before they finished the business with beall and began riding down the stream </s>
<s> they had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five mexicans riding along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them </s>
<s> suspecting an ambush the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into catskill </s>
<s> to the west of this road was another low bluff forty or fifty feet high covered with scrub oak and other brush </s>
<s> as they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers </s>
<s> not a bullet touched cook who was nearer the ambush but one hit russell in the leg and another broke his arm passing on through his body </s>
<s> grabbing his winchester from its sheath cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank </s>
<s> bullets were so thick throwing sand in his face that he found it difficult to return the fire </s>
<s> at a very shallow place two mexicans rushed into the open for a shot </s>
<s> dropping to one knee cook felled one and the other struggled off with his comrade sending no further fire in his direction </s>
<s> just before leaving the arroyo where he was partially concealed he did hear shots down at the house </s>
<s> a bullet fired by one of the mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed through his head tearing a hole two-inches square on the outgoing side </s>
<s> macpherson boldly approached the fortified adobe house and demanded entrance </s>
<s> the men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid </s>
<s> the officer demanded the names of the injured men </s>
<s> the mexicans not only refused to give them but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it </s>
<s> since the strength of the mexicans had been underrated too small a posse had been collected and since the deputy had not been provided with search warrants macpherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw </s>
<s> during the following week six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned </s>
<s> some buildings farm tools two horses plows and hay owned by bonito lavato a friendly interpreter for the company and pedro chavez hay were stolen or destroyed </s>
<s> and a store was broken into and robbed </s>

<s> they were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the vermejo and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot </s>
<s> and the law virtually ignored the situation </s>
<s> public money spent </s>
<s> justice delayed </s>
<s> word reached the company that the man behind these depredations was manuel gonzales a man with many followers including a number who were kept in line through fear of him </s>
<s> although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named asher jones the warrant for his arrest had never been served </s>
<s> still there was no gonzales and the family would say nothing </s>
<s> while prowling around these buildings two of the posse recognized the voice of gonzales speaking to the people inside </s>
<s> he was promised that no harm would befall him if he would come out but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door </s>
<s> the posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive </s>
<s> again he refused </s>
<s> in deadly earnest the besiegers methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags inside only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit the floor </s>
<s> when it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer taking a thousand to one chance gonzales rushed outside square against the muzzle of a winchester </s>
<s> shot near the heart he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away three bullets following him </s>
<s> as he pushed open the door he fell on his face one of his comrades pulling him inside </s>
<s> not realizing the seriousness of the wound the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him </s>
<s> receiving no answer they set the fire </s>
<s> when the house was about half consumed his comrade ran to the door and threw up his hands declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of manuel </s>
<s> finding it true that he was not inside the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket </s>
<s> several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand </s>
<s> there was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who though numbering in the fifties had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack </s>
<s> the sheriff and district attorney mills hastily swore out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed according to signed statements by chavez and dr i p george and ordered deputy barney clark of raton to rescue the posseman </s>
<s> the men helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to raton along with three other families desiring to leave </s>
<s> the ten or more dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large and pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe houses defending themselves through loopholes it would be most difficult to capture them </s>
<s> he wisely decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup particularly since the mexicans were on their guard </s>
<s> his problem then became one of restraining the american fighters who wanted to clean out the vermejo by force immediately </s>
<s> the plant was located west of the battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant </s>
<s> it has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the battenkill </s>

<s> as new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of school street are served by it </s>
<s> b j connell is the present treasurer and manager </s>
<s> the layout of the sewer lines was designed by henry w taylor who was the engineer for the manchester village disposal plant </s>
<s> no figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town </s>
<s> there the matter stands with the prospect that soon manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams </s>
<s> telephone and telegraph </s>
<s> a message of less than fifteen words to bennington cost twenty-five cents </s>
<s> orvis even needed to hire an assistant clark j wait </s>
<s> the manchester journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business </s>
<s> the line soon lived up to its name as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital stock </s>

<s> but companies continued to spring up </s>
<s> h k fowler vice-president and secretary </s>
<s> j n hard treasurer </s>
<s> f h walker superintendent </s>
<s> h s walker assistant superintendent </s>
<s> operators were arthur koop and norman taylor </s>
<s> during the summers towsley often needed the assistance of a company operator </s>
<s> these were the years when people flocked to manchester not only to play golf which had come into vogue but also to witness the ekwanok country club tournaments </s>
<s> new yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers </s>
<s> this boosted local telegraph business and manchester basked in all the free advertising </s>
<s> during summers business was so brisk that mrs wilcox had two assistants and a messenger </s>
<s> she was succeeded by clarence goyette </s>
<s> after being located for some years in the village at the equinox pharmacy under the supervision of mrs harry mercier it is presently located in the hill and dale shop manchester center </s>
<s> george woodcock was manager and troubleshooter </s>
<s> elizabeth way was the first operator </s>
<s> and a night operator was also employed </s>
<s> anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the manchester journal </s>
<s> more aerial and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business </s>
<s> this eliminated toll calls between the two towns </s>
<s> within a month calls were up seventy per cent </s>
<s> electric power </s>
<s> electricity plays such an important part in community life today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not available for daily use </s>
<s> yet one has to go back only some sixty years </s>
<s> this was working by the end of august and giving satisfactory service </s>
<s> nothing came of it perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage </s>
<s> the next step was construction by the manchester light and power company of a plant on the west bank of the battenkill south of union street bridge </s>
<s> it was at the end of the sidewalk in front of the dellwood cemetery cottage </s>
<s> the first directors of the manchester light and power company were john marsden m l manley william f orvis george smith and john blackmer </s>
<s> the officers were john marsden president </s>
<s> john c blackmer vice-president </s>
<s> george smith treasurer </s>

<s> with respect to this view two points are worth making </s>
<s> more believed that a man could be both serious and gay </s>
<s> that a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of </s>
<s> indeed it is even surprising in the canon of christ church and regius professor of ecclesiastical history who fathered this most peculiar view and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance english at cambridge who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent </s>
<s> utopia is still widely read because in a sense more stood on the margin of modernity </s>
<s> and if he did stand on the margins of modernity it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as papal supremacy might be able to force on western christendom </s>
<s> similar literary exercises were the common doings of a christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century </s>
<s> and the evidence that he does indeed stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so </s>
<s> remember that in seeking the modern in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance there </s>
<s> we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval the renaissance and the modern </s>
<s> the medieval was the most important to chambers because he sought to place thomas more the author of utopia in some intelligible relation with st thomas more the martyr </s>
<s> to others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of christian humanism the renaissance elements are of primary concern </s>
<s> but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation </s>
<s> we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has </s>
<s> we want to know what is perennially new about utopia </s>
<s> to that question the answer is simple </s>
<s> it can be made in two words utopian communism </s>
<s> but it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials </s>
<s> surely there is nothing new about communism </s>
<s> this conception was taken up by the early church fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the middle ages </s>
<s> and more was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it </s>
<s> we are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus platonic stoic early christian monastic canonist or theological communism </s>
<s> perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory </s>
<s> we will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not </s>
<s> its function is to separate from the base ruled mass among whom private ownership prevails the governing warrior elite </s>
<s> and it is to this problem that the republic ultimately returns </s>
<s> utopian communism applies to all utopians </s>
<s> and in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central </s>
<s> the concern of utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu the best ordering of a civil society </s>
<s> and it is again and again made clear that utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering </s>
<s> the apostolic community was literally an elite chosen by christ himself </s>
<s> and the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors their spiritual athleticism </s>
<s> in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the fall of man </s>
<s> it did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned </s>
<s> the actual function of patristic communism was adequately set forth by st gregory almost a millenium before more wrote utopia </s>
<s> when we give the necessities of life to the poor we restore to them what is already theirs </s>
<s> because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his </s>
<s> indeed of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian </s>
<s> he is a trustee for the common good however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund wisely or unwisely entrusted to his keeping </s>
<s> in contrast to this stoic-patristic view utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve </s>
<s> the utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions </s>
<s> in a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice so often still </s>
<s> in all the respects just indicated utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role </s>
<s> neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced </s>
<s> we do not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus found the tales of the house of atreus among the folk lore of the greeks </s>
<s> it is not merely a new thing </s>
<s> it is one of the very few new things in utopia </s>
<s> most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism </s>
<s> but to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern </s>
<s> consider the features of utopian communism generous public provision for the infirm </s>
<s> democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests meals taken publicly in common refectories </s>
<s> a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens </s>
<s> even houses changed once a decade </s>
<s> six hours of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking </s>
<s> no private property no money </s>
<s> no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term </s>
<s> whatever the merits of its intent utopian communism is far too naive far too crude to suit any modern socialist or communist </s>
<s> it is not the details of utopian communism that make utopia modern it is the spirit the attitude of mind that informs those details </s>
<s> what that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history the one which reached christianity by the way of stoicism through the church fathers of late antiquity </s>
<s> during the dorr trial the democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded dorr as a martyr to the principles of the declaration of independence </s>
<s> the two major newspapers in providence continued throughout the crisis to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history </s>
<s> while the daily post continued to accuse republicans and the daily journal continued to accuse democrats the woonsocket patriot complained that the virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn brown and his men </s>
<s> the providence daily post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings </s>
<s> the providence daily journal stated that although the guilt of brown was evident the south must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace </s>
<s> upon receiving the news northern writers editors and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the southern states particularly virginia </s>
<s> the editor of the newport advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital punishment </s>
<s> in direct contrast to the other rhode island editors samuel s foss of the woonsocket patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair </s>
<s> despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of john brown rhode islanders turned their attention to the state elections </s>
<s> the state had elected republican candidates in the past two years </s>
<s> there was no doubt as to the control the republican party exercised throughout the state </s>
<s> if it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state offices by majorities the failure was due to a lingering remnant of the know-nothing party which called itself the american republican party </s>

<s> during the month of november hardly a day passed when there was not some mention of john brown in the rhode island newspapers </s>

<s> no sympathy or admiration for brown could be found in the providence daily post for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy </s>
<s> the newport mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him </s>
<s> a week later the daily journal had discovered the initial plans of some providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring john brown on the day of his execution </s>
<s> he further called upon the people of providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace </s>
<s> extraordinary precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold </s>
<s> in many northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled </s>
<s> such was not the case in rhode island </s>
<s> seated on the platform were amos c barstow ex-mayor of providence and a wealthy republican stove manufacturer </s>
<s> thomas davis an uncompromising garrisonian </s>
<s> the reverend augustus woodbury a unitarian minister </s>
<s> the reverend george t day a free-will baptist </s>
<s> daniel w vaughan and william h h clements </s>
<s> the latter two were appointed secretaries </s>
<s> the first speaker was amos c barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting </s>
<s> the next speaker was george t day </s>
<s> the fourth and last speaker was thomas davis </s>
<s> by this time large numbers of the audience had left the hall </s>
<s> davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city </s>
<s> he said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments </s>
<s> at the close of davis speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously </s>
<s> whereas john brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper therefore </s>
<s> resolved that while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects yet in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor </s>
<s> resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in kansas occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice </s>
<s> resolved that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action </s>
<s> on the morning following the pratt hall meeting the editor of the providence daily journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes it could have been avoided completely </s>
<s> rather than being deceived the eye is puzzled </s>
<s> to reinforce and sometimes to replace the simulated typography braque and picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint </s>
<s> the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas </s>
<s> in certain other pictures however braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing </s>
<s> that is by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface </s>
<s> the accumulation of such devices however soon had the effect of telescoping even while separating surface and depth </s>
<s> the process of flattening seemed inexorable and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion </s>
<s> but it is also true that braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography </s>
<s> when we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each </s>
<s> but here again the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim </s>
<s> because of the size of the areas it covers the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily as more than an indication or sign </s>
<s> literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture and the device boomerangs the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before </s>
<s> instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture </s>
<s> and the surface is driven back in its very surfaceness only by this contrast </s>
<s> at the same time the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them and by their placing in relation to the block capitals </s>
<s> and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining </s>
<s> thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane </s>
<s> and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface </s>
<s> in later collages of both masters a variety of extraneous materials are used sometimes in the same work and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think of </s>
<s> planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially </s>
<s> all this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it </s>
<s> rather it underpins and reinforces that literalness re-creates it </s>
<s> out of this re-created literalness the cubist subject reemerged </s>
<s> for it had turned out by a further paradox of cubism that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging </s>
<s> in the analytical phase of their cubism braque and picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it </s>
<s> in order to be saved plasticity had had to be isolated </s>
<s> and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the cubist method the subject itself became largely unrecognizable </s>
<s> it was then that picasso and braque were confronted with a unique dilemma they had to choose between illusion and representation </s>
<s> it was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become for the first time mutually exclusive alternatives </s>
<s> in the end picasso and braque plumped for the representational and it would seem they did so deliberately </s>
<s> left in their previous atom-like smallness they would have cut away too abruptly into depth </s>
<s> and the broad opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane </s>
<s> large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes and to the extent that they are flat they also assert themselves as silhouettes </s>
<s> analytical cubism came to an end in the collage but not conclusively </s>
<s> nor did synthetic cubism fully begin there </s>
<s> only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil and transformed by this translation did cubism become an affair of positive color and flat interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to if not the illusion of unmistakable three-dimensional identities </s>
<s> this was the point at which he finally took the lead in cubist innovation away from braque never again to relinquish it </s>
<s> but even before that picasso had glimpsed and entered for a moment a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him </s>
<s> to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut strings thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture plane </s>
<s> the affixed elements of collage were extruded as it were and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief </s>
<s> however the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever </s>
<s> the new interchange among the four los angeles freeways including the grade-constructed accesses occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land one-eighth of a square mile an area about the size of rockefeller center in new york </s>
<s> it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services </s>
<s> subways improved land values without taking away land </s>
<s> the freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem but it also acts inevitably as an artificial isolating boundary </s>
<s> city planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might </s>
<s> meanwhile the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance </s>
<s> the appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor </s>
<s> to light industry the economies of being on one floor are much slighter but efficiency engineers usually believe in them and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers </s>
<s> this movement of industry away from the central cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe </s>
<s> it is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all american cities </s>
<s> the truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site </s>
<s> until internal combustion became cheap he had to be near a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community of lower-class homes </s>
<s> but anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days and many businesses can live without the railroad </s>
<s> and there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory </s>
<s> they are all suburban plants relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers </s>
<s> and wherever the new thruways go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry </s>
<s> the future could be worse </s>
<s> they are segregated businesses combining again on one site the factory and the office drawing their work force from segregated communities </s>
<s> in spreading the factories even farther the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities </s>
<s> the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every year </s>
<s> what hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing especially in those cities where public transit is feeble </s>
<s> in most discussions of this phenomenon the figures are substantially inflated </s>
<s> telephone orders distort the picture the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city number if both are listed in an advertisement especially if the local call eliminates city sales tax </s>
<s> the suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened </s>
<s> accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are </s>
<s> the fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches </s>
<s> moreover the cost of operations is always high in any new store as the conservative bankers who act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover </s>
<s> when all has been said however the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of american retailing </s>
<s> just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store though both are the same distance from home </s>
<s> indeed there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown </s>
<s> raymond vernon reports that residents of east st louis have been driving across the mississippi through the heart of downtown st louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town </s>
<s> to the extent that the problem is merely parking an aggressive downtown management like that of lazarus brothers in columbus ohio can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door </s>
<s> if the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems however the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program </s>
<s> the downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety both within its gates and across the street where other department stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making up her mind </s>
<s> department stores were built on dry goods especially ladies fashions and in this area in the long run the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown </s>
<s> historically in america the appeal of cities has been their color and life the variety of experience they offered </s>
<s> was a question that had to be asked long before they saw paree </s>
<s> though americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown </s>
<s> suburbs and negroes </s>
<s> bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the u s government </s>
<s> the artistic generation after brumidi was trained in the paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find </s>
<s> but it is a great conception </s>
<s> the open ceiling with allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky the closed frieze formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls belong in their large ordering to the line of correggio and his baroque followers </s>
<s> the descent may be remote but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the united states </s>
<s> constantino brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole in collaboration with the architect charles u walter at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure </s>
<s> after many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco and slightly less than half the frieze beginning with the liberty group opposite the east door and ending with william penn all but one leg when a tragic accident ended his career </s>
<s> he left at his death sketches drawn to scale for the rest of the circle </s>
<s> when costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six feet of empty frieze were left over </s>
<s> later the cleaning and restoration were ordered first of the older part of the frieze finally of the canopy </s>
<s> what follows is therefore a description of three separate undertakings the new frescoing of the gap and the successive essays in conservation with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each </s>
<s> for the use of students and future restorers a full day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings complete technical reports on what we found and what we did </s>
<s> these may be consulted in the office of the architect of the capitol or the library of congress </s>
<s> the first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished length of frieze a jumble of roughcast and finish coats all in bad condition </s>
<s> it was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older artists preparation with a mortar one part slaked lime three parts sand to be put on in two layers </s>
<s> cartoons were drawn full size after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities </s>
<s> there was some difficulty here </s>
<s> moreover all three representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length brumidi allowed for each one of his </s>
<s> when it was all arranged to fit and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze the cartoons were tried in place </s>
<s> the scaffolding a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above was strong and safe but obscured visibility </s>
<s> nothing could be seen from the floor but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses </s>
<s> and we were able to decide on some amplification of scale </s>
<s> to be sure of matching color as well as form pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast and large samples painted in fresco then left two months to dry out to their final key </s>
<s> later it was gratifying to note that they had set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came </s>
<s> the scaffold was the length of the space to be painted </s>
<s> what bits of brumidi and costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good order though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust </s>
<s> washed they came out surprisingly clear and bright </s>
<s> that is they used opaque color throughout getting solid highlights with active lime white </s>
<s> a brown hatching reinforces and broadens shadows and much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat </s>
<s> this brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint </s>
<s> the mortar was three parts sand to two of lime </s>
<s> some of the lime that is always on hand in the capitol basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us </s>
<s> i am told that a mortar longer slaked might have remained longer in condition for painting </s>
<s> as it was it took the pigment well for six hours enough for our purpose and held it firmly in setting </s>
<s> it was obvious that to match brumidi white must be mixed with all but the darkest tones </s>
<s> other pigments were mostly raw umber some burnt umber and a little yellow ochre </s>
<s> experience showed however that it is very difficult to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty and uneven </s>
<s> later brumidi and costaggini will be seen coping with this same problem </s>
<s> we were forced as they were to work a good deal of tempera into background and dark areas </s>
<s> ground together they made a strong adhesive which became waterproof in drying </s>
<s> the new part is finished </s>
<s> on the right is the brumidi liberty group as it looked after cleaning operations which had not yet come around to the other end </s>
<s> where of costaggini only some foliage has been washed at the point where his work stopped </s>
<s> one is led to speculate as to why the empty space was there left for our century to finish </s>
<s> the startlingly bright effect of the first washings led the committee to order the rest of the brumidi-costaggini cycle cleaned and restored to go with them </s>
<s> the fixed wooden scaffold was removed and so as to reach all the frieze one of pipe on wheels built up from the floor </s>
<s> every few days in the early morning as the work progressed twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the rotunda pavement supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting </s>
<s> on this giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor after a first dusting we began to wash </s>
<s> a valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower </s>
<s> one man sprayed with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting </s>
<s> a second assistant mopped with two sponges </s>
<s> in parts a repeated sponging was needed but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore the original brightness </s>
<s> no soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in unwanted chemical reactions </s>
<s> necessary retouching was put on at once </s>
<s> we were greatly helped by there being no traces of former restoring </s>
<s> apparently not more than dusting had ever been done and not much of that </s>
<s> the plaster was sound the intonaco firmly attached all over and the pigment solidly incorporated with it in all but a few unimportant places </s>
<s> here the architect referring to the use of the capitol as a public building not a museum requested some repainting to maintain decorative effect rather than leaving blank unsightly patches </s>
<s> these frescos have had no care for eighty years </s>
<s> with naked gas jets below and leaky windows above enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium they have survived in a building long unheated in winter hot and damp under the iron dome in summer </s>
<s> those whom i wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me </s>
<s> it may well be that when rudy pozzatti and i visited your country last spring you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked </s>
<s> as american artists it was natural that we would want to meet as many soviet artists as possible </s>
<s> this letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful </s>
<s> even though we did not see many of your faces it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard from those whom we had the fortune to encounter that we had been in your midst </s>
<s> i am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the ussr </s>
<s> i can well understand your curiosity </s>
<s> we ourselves are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live </s>
<s> it is my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the union of soviet artists </s>
<s> there should be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter </s>
<s> pozzatti and i endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes </s>
<s> the time-span of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert on anything i saw </s>
<s> nevertheless i consider it reasonable because of my commitment as an artist to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific geo-political interests </s>
<s> if this attitude is seriously questioned in the soviet union it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which i live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view </s>
<s> it is a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the plight of a minority such as artists in any social order </s>
<s> i encountered many questions and great interest upon my return from the soviet union about my reactions to that experience </s>
<s> that which i found most profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction </s>
<s> almost as if i were talking about something quite unreal </s>
<s> apparently this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen objectively or at least dispassionately to individual impressions of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments </s>
<s> personal predispositions tend to blunt the ear and in turn the voice as well </s>
<s> i cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat unusual travelogue </s>
<s> i am equally impatient with the shrug of the shoulder shake of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so long </s>
<s> the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical horizons </s>
<s> difficult as it may have been at times pozzatti and i saw enough talked to enough artists historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear </s>
<s> artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends of humanity </s>
<s> they are small in number and their contribution is not immediately decisive in everyday life </s>
<s> by themselves they may not be able to save the life on this planet but without them there would be very little left worth saving </s>
<s> it cannot be said that our very first day in the soviet union turned out to be an ordinary one </s>
<s> if we thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national achievement our last day to us at least was equally impressive and very moving even though the crowds were absent and there was almost complete silence </s>
<s> we stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country just outside of moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of a russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor </s>
<s> the grave about half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green the sounds of birds the silence of other graves and the casual paths through small forests </s>
<s> just yesterday we had met and talked with a living writer a contemporary of the dead poet who is known for his ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously </s>
<s> but today we were aware of only two men </s>
<s> one had taken a flight into uncharted space in the service of science to return as a living hero </s>
<s> the other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit </s>
<s> these two recollections form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which to me at least symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between materialism and humanism </s>
<s> a struggle that is being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest </s>
<s> the prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was elaborated even further with an incredible semantic dexterity </s>
<s> the socialist environment it was stated had cross-fertilized these two extreme seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit </s>
<s> when i speculated on one such occasion that the new growth like other mutations might be unable to propagate i was immediately accused of preaching racial prejudice </s>
<s> this kind of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to </s>
<s> after a while we were perhaps less surprised but still puzzled when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and illogical comparisons </s>
<s> theories of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern of gaseous masses </s>
<s> no wonder that pozzatti and i had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence namely cultural exchange </s>
<s> typical of such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the union of soviet artists </s>
<s> instead we became involved in a series of friendly but overly formal welcoming addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind </s>
<s> the terms of friendship understanding cooperation etc tend to become somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use </s>
<s> i can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion </s>
<s> the presiding female functionary of massive proportions and forbidding appearance initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing the arts </s>
<s> it was only after we had responded with what i fear were similar cliches that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the us government in cuba and laos </s>
<s> she retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there </s>
<s> unfortunately she returned later just as i had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the cultural exchange program would be the re-emergence of abstract art in russia with social realism regaining dominance in the us </s>
<s> this gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition that we should not presume to lecture her on abstraction </s>
<s> she did not go so far as to say as was done on other occasions that abstraction as well as impressionism were a russian invention that had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the ussr </s>
<s> pozzatti and i could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in moscow than elsewhere </s>
<s> until our moscow experience i had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally </s>
<s> artists simply do not talk to each other in that fashion </s>
<s> and furthermore i could not presume the implication that i spoke for american artists as a group </s>
<s> to save time some clarification seemed necessary </s>
<s> the following is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in leningrad </s>
<s> our presence here should also be considered further sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer peaceful ties among all people </s>
<s> we are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between individuals </s>
<s> in spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit </s>
<s> we are acutely aware that yours is a society which in spite of several wars and many privations has developed itself into one of the foremost nations of the world </s>
<s> your past history is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect </s>
<s> your present history is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements </s>
<s> we have come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours </s>
<s> while we as american artists believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity we would be less than honest with you or ourselves if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole </s>
<s> in stating this position we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect </s>
<s> as a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people so much that we will not presume to speak for all other american artists </s>
<s> but certainly all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for similarities between you and us but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding </s>
<s> like yourselves we have pride and love for our country </s>
<s> to many of us this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian terror in order to live in dignified freedom </s>
<s> as artists we feel the same obligation as do other individuals in considering ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation </s>
<s> the sane society is an ambitious work </s>
<s> even a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots errors of fact and argument important exclusions areas of ignorance and prejudice undue emphases on trivia examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence and the like </s>
<s> such books are easy prey for critics </s>
<s> nor need the critic be captious </s>
<s> a careful and orderly man who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility might easily be put off by such a book </s>
<s> it is a simple matter for one so disposed to take a work like the sane society and shred it into odds and ends </s>
<s> that could be easily done but there is little reason in it </s>
<s> it would come down to saying that fromm paints with a broad brush and that after all is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the outset </s>
<s> it would be superfluous to build a critique around them </s>
<s> almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation </s>
<s> despite its rather long intellectual history alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a verified theory </s>
<s> the idea has received much attention in philosophy in literature and in a few works of general social criticism such as the sane society </s>
<s> until such work is done there must remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the malaise of the intellectual who rejected by and in turn rejecting the larger society projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen </s>
<s> i am not suggesting that fromm ought to do this kind of work </s>
<s> nor do i think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual </s>
<s> i am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence comes in any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations </s>
<s> until such evidence appears we must make do with the evidence we have </s>
<s> here perhaps fromm is vulnerable for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather special ways </s>
<s> three examples follow </s>
<s> the broad conclusions of that pioneering work remain undisturbed but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support has suggested important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference and has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area </s>
<s> fromm seems unaware of these developments </s>
<s> another example is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of topics he cites such survey-type findings just three times </s>
<s> moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible </s>
<s> fromm says these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread </s>
<s> that is one way to read the findings but again there are other ways </s>
<s> he seems to use the term alienation in two different ways </s>
<s> sometimes he uses it as a subjective descriptive term and sometimes as an objective diagnostic one </s>
<s> that is sometimes it is used to describe felt human misery and other times it is postulated to explain unfelt anxiety and discontent </s>
<s> the failure to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader </s>
<s> it also permits fromm to do some dubious things with empirical findings </s>
<s> when alienation is used as an objective and diagnostic category for example it becomes clear that fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward conquering it </s>
<s> thus in the example cited above fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being deprived unconsciously unknowingly of fulfillment and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious experienced frustrations </s>
<s> he has his cake and eats it too if the workers say they are dissatisfied this shows conscious alienation </s>
<s> if they say they are satisfied this shows unconscious alienation </s>
<s> there is nothing remarkable about this at all </s>
<s> glance at the list burckhardt tolstoy proudhon thoreau london marx tawney mayo durkheim tannenbaum mumford a r heron huxley schweitzer and einstein </s>
<s> this is a delightfully motley collection </s>
<s> one can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear </s>
<s> the method of selection fromm uses achieves exactly that </s>
<s> furthermore the list is interesting for its omissions </s>
<s> it omits for example practically the whole line of great nineteenth century english social critics nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious and all those who are with more or less accuracy called existentialists </s>
<s> these almost by definition are spokesmen for an alienated ideology </s>
<s> it is not hard to find that concurrence of opinion which fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion </s>
<s> one such instance has already been presented his use of alienation </s>
<s> the only other one i shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism </s>
<s> for fromm capitalism is the enemy the root of all evil </s>
<s> in this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera </s>
<s> such composers as monteverdi lully and purcell with the same goal in mind had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages </s>
<s> through long experimentation in his songs mussorgsky developed a russian recitative as different from others as the language itself </s>
<s> giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words </s>
<s> the moments of sung melody in the usual sense come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing as in folk songs and liturgical chants </s>
<s> even then the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance </s>
<s> aside from boris himself one need but examine the secondary roles to place mussorgsky among the masters of musical portraiture </s>
<s> even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities defined with economical precision </s>
<s> consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action pimen varlaam missail and the jesuit rangoni </s>
<s> under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other </s>
<s> each musical setting has an individual touch </s>
<s> a quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life </s>
<s> it changes and develops according to the text </s>
<s> it introduces pimen when he comes before boris in the last act </s>
<s> once he has been identified however a new melody is used to accompany his narrative a bleak motif with barren octaves creating a rather ancient effect </s>
<s> here the composer uses a favorite device of his the intensification of the mood through key relationships </s>
<s> the original d minor seems to symbolize blindness inescapable in spite of all attempts to move away from it </s>
<s> varlaam and missail always appear together and often sing together in a straightforward rhythmically vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from the more subtle and well-educated pimen </s>
<s> their begging song might easily be a folk melody </s>
<s> the same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene </s>
<s> apparently their origin is humble their approach to life direct and unsophisticated </s>
<s> missail is the straight man not very talkative mild-mannered when he does speak </s>
<s> varlaam is loud rowdy uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same </s>
<s> a rough ostinato figure heard first in the introduction to the inn scene characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into the action </s>
<s> the song of kazan in which this figure becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment fills in the picture of undisciplined high spirits </s>
<s> the phrasing is irregular and the abrupt key changes have a primitive forcefulness </s>
<s> as the knack gradually comes back to him his rhythm becomes steadier with the rigid monotony of an unskilled reader </s>
<s> for the only time in the opera words are not set according to their natural inflection </s>
<s> to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene </s>
<s> musically and dramatically rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as varlaam </s>
<s> his speech shows none of the native accent of the russian characters </s>
<s> in spite of the italian name he sounds french </s>
<s> the effect is as if he had materialized out of nowhere </s>
<s> he speaks quietly concealing his authority beneath a smooth humility just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them </s>
<s> it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name placing himself by implication in the position of a solicitous father </s>
<s> curiously this scene is a close parallel to one that verdi was writing at the same time the scene between amonasro and aida </s>
<s> rangoni begins by describing the sad state of the church </s>
<s> this brings a reaction of distress from marina </s>
<s> the music becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own sainthood it is she he tells her who can bring the truth to russia and convert the heretics </s>
<s> this is no assignment for a frivolous girl she assures him </s>
<s> now rangoni comes to the point and we hear for the first time a long downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of his sinister power </s>
<s> another theme sinuously chromatic appears as he directs her to gain power over grigori by any means even at the cost of her honor </s>
<s> coming from a priest the music sounds as odd as the advice </s>
<s> marina rebels at this suggestion </s>
<s> her pride is as much at stake as her virtue </s>
<s> she is the unattainable beauty the princess who turns away suitors by the dozen </s>
<s> indignantly she denounces rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her </s>
<s> at once the jesuit pulls out all the stops </s>
<s> to music of a menacing darkness he describes the powers of satan gaining control of the girl poisoning her soul with pride and destroying her beauty </s>
<s> the combined threat of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her and she falls terrified at his feet </s>
<s> we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love duet again throwing a chill over the atmosphere </s>
<s> the most unusual feature of boris however is the use of the greatest character of all the chorus </s>
<s> this is the real protagonist of the drama </s>
<s> the conflict is not boris versus grigori or shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child but boris versus the russian people </s>
<s> mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent to which choral scenes propel the action </s>
<s> boris first entrance seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the coronation scene with its dazzling confusion of tonalities </s>
<s> one reason for the unique vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression </s>
<s> it rarely speaks as a unit </s>
<s> even in its most conventional appearance the guests song of praise to marina there are a few female dissenters criticizing the princess for her coldness </s>
<s> hot arguments arise between tenors and basses who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea </s>
<s> the opening scene shows this method at its most individual </s>
<s> mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people those who must suffer the effects of their rulers struggle for power without understanding the causes </s>
<s> they are held in control by force but barely </s>
<s> they will kneel and plead for boris leadership in a strangely intense song its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath but when the police with their cudgels move away they mock and grumble and fight among themselves </s>

<s> so far these remarks like most criticisms of hardy have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development </s>
<s> one might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years some changes in style and method would have occurred some development taken place </s>
<s> this is not however the case and development is a term which we can apply to hardy only in a very limited sense </s>
<s> in a time when poetic style and poetic belief as well seem in a state of continual flux hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistency </s>
<s> though he struggled with philosophy all his life he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties </s>
<s> and though in his later years he revised his poems many times the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty </s>
<s> so that while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by hardy it is difficult to date one </s>
<s> there is only one hardy style but in the earlier poems that style is only intermittently evident and when it is not the style is the style of another poet or of the fashion of the time </s>
<s> in the later poems however the personal tone predominates </s>
<s> the bad early poems are bad shakespeare or bad swinburne </s>
<s> the bad late poems are bad hardy </s>
<s> these dates are virtually the only clues we have to the chronology of the poems since the separate volumes are neither chronological within themselves nor in relation to each other </s>
<s> the dated poems also give us an idea of the degree to which hardy drew upon past productions for his various volumes and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time </s>
<s> satires of circumstance and moments of vision coming during his most productive decade are relatively self-contained </s>
<s> two entries in the early life support the assumption that during this period hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry </s>
<s> and the first world war </s>
<s> we may carry this sequence one step further and say that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers wanting only the impetus of two tragedies one personal the other national to loose those powers in poetry </s>
<s> like a wise gardener hardy pruned away the shakespearian sonnets and songs and the elements of meter and poetic diction to which his personal style was not suited and let the main stock of his talent flourish </s>
<s> the range of the later poetry is considerably narrower but the number of successful poems is far greater </s>
<s> almost anyone could have written it </s>
<s> it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form but it is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike hardy </s>
<s> the language is the conventional language of the form </s>
<s> there is no phrase or image that sounds like hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality to the poem </s>
<s> it is smoother than hardy usually is but with the smoothness of anonymity </s>
<s> there are many such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems </s>
<s> if it is somber it is also precise and the precision lends authority to the vision </s>
<s> hardy was not hardy very often </s>
<s> these are the poems hardy wrote after the death of his first wife </s>
<s> they compose a painful elegy to what might have been to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness and ended in long years of suffering and hatred </s>
<s> hardy obviously felt that these poems were peculiarly personal and private </s>
<s> the view is always toward the past </s>
<s> the fire of love is dead and hardy stands as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence over the burnt circle of charred sticks and thinks of past happiness and present grief honest and uncomforted </s>
<s> critically invisible modern revolt like x-rays and radioactivity is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels where it is called delinquency </s>
<s> if the word deliberate means anything both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves </s>
<s> both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art </s>
<s> both of them were my friends </s>
<s> living in san francisco i saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue </s>
<s> so as the years passed i saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration </s>
<s> about dawn he got up to blow </s>
<s> the rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent melody spiraled through it </s>
<s> the last time i saw dylan his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality </s>
<s> it had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter </s>
<s> being with him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones </s>
<s> now dylan thomas and charlie parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end </s>
<s> as artists they were very similar </s>
<s> they were both very fluent </s>
<s> but this fluent enchanting utterance had compared with important artists of the past relatively little content </s>
<s> neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture at his own creativity </s>
<s> music of course is not so explicit an art but anybody who knew charlie parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift </s>
<s> it is the theme of horace who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance to parker or thomas </s>
<s> the difference is that horace accepted his theme with a kind of silken assurance </s>
<s> to dylan and bird it was an agony and terror </s>
<s> i do not believe that this is due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity </s>
<s> i believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole value </s>
<s> art may have been for him the most enduring orderly and noble activity of man </s>
<s> but the other activities of his life partook of these values </s>
<s> they did not actively negate them </s>
<s> he was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air raids and gas ovens </s>
<s> as the world began to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven i believe his art became meaningless to him </s>
<s> thomas and parker have more in common than theme attitude life pattern </s>
<s> in the practice of their art there is an obvious technical resemblance </s>
<s> contrary to popular belief they were not great technical innovators </s>
<s> their effects are only superficially startling </s>
<s> thomas is a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writers like pierre reverdy or apollinaire </s>
<s> similarly the innovations of bop and of parker particularly have been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with music especially by that ignoramus the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado </s>
<s> the tonal novelties consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music for centuries </s>
<s> and there is less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz no matter how progressive and dixieland than there is between two movements of many conventional symphonies </s>
<s> it is true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously or at least is continuously sprung so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or strophe </s>
<s> this is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to rococo music </s>
<s> it is the difference between bach and mozart </s>
<s> it is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what thomas did to poetry </s>
<s> the metaphysical conceits which fascinate the reactionary generation still dominant in backwater american colleges were embroideries </s>
<s> this is one difference between bird and dylan which should be pointed out </s>
<s> again contrary to popular belief there is nothing crazy or frantic about parker either musically or emotionally </s>
<s> his sinuous melody is a sort of naive transcendence of all experience </s>
<s> emotionally it does not resemble berlioz or wagner </s>
<s> it resembles mozart </s>
<s> this is true also of a painter like jackson pollock </s>
<s> he may have been eccentric in his behavior but his paintings are as impassive as persian tiles </s>
<s> partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication </s>
<s> the insistent talk-aboutiveness of the general environment obtrudes into even the most idyllic poetry </s>
<s> it is much more a personal difference </s>
<s> thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world </s>
<s> parker and pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world </s>
<s> technique pure and simple rendition is not of major importance but it is interesting that parker following lester young was one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution </s>
<s> in modern jazz the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional embouchure </s>
<s> i want to make clear what i consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts </s>
<s> ornament is confabulation in the interstices of structure </s>
<s> confabulation has come to determine structure </s>
<s> parker certainly had much more of an influence </s>
<s> at one time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school band in america to blow like bird </s>
<s> even before his death this influence had begun to ebb </s>
<s> the main line of development today goes back to lester young and by-passes them </s>
<s> the point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are aberrant idiosyncratic </s>
<s> there is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from baudelaire to eluard or for that matter from hawthorne through henry james to gertrude stein </s>
<s> i doubt if anyone holds such ideas today </s>
<s> continuity exits but like the neo-swing music developed from lester young it is a continuity sustained by popular demand </s>
<s> in the plastic arts a very similar situation exists </s>
<s> but it is obvious that they were self-deluded </s>
<s> nothing looks anything like an ernst or an arp but another ernst or arp </s>
<s> nothing looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion </s>
<s> the aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist but it is a very impoverished appeal </s>
<s> once again what has happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals the accidents of painting </s>
<s> the splashes of light and black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of hals and sargent </s>
<s> you have only to compare such painting with the work of say sesshu to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly </s>
<s> at its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo decorative surface </s>
<s> its poverty shows up immediately when compared with tiepolo where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity and power </s>
<s> a tiepolo painting however confabulated is a universe of tensions in vast depths </s>
<s> in fact once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper </s>
<s> now there is nothing wrong with complicated wallpaper </s>
<s> there is just more to tiepolo </s>
<s> a process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long </s>
<s> anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age </s>
<s> nothing in all this is autobiographical unlike the poets of deor and widsith the poet of beowulf is not concerned with his own identity </s>
<s> the poet of the odyssey reputed blind reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel demodocus </s>
<s> since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter there is prima-facie evidence that beowulf and the homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition </s>
<s> that such a tradition lies behind the iliad and the odyssey at least is hard to deny </s>
<s> milman parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant homeric poems are largely formulaic and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of greek epic survived </s>
<s> he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas </s>
<s> yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment beowulf and the homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent </s>
<s> the bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very skilful oral poet but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty even in a language of many terminal inflections </s>
<s> assonance seems nearly as severe a curb although in a celebrated passage william of malmesbury declares that a song of roland was intoned before the battle commenced at hastings </s>
<s> the anglo-saxon alliterative line and the homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint </s>
<s> the verse of beowulf or of the iliad and the odyssey was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents perforce in earning a livelihood </s>
<s> yet certain aids were valuable and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without a pause </s>
<s> the poet in a written tradition who generally never blots a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame </s>
<s> but the oral poet cannot pause </s>
<s> he must improvise continuously with no apparent effort </s>
<s> even though the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition </s>
<s> the germanic poet had such aids in the kennings which provided for the difficulties of alliteration </s>
<s> the homeric poet had epithets which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter </s>
<s> either poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns </s>
<s> other synonyms could of course serve the same function and for the sake of ease i shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest possible sense and name for example gar-dene a kenning for the danes </s>
<s> verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents and to designate the members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic language </s>
<s> limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in anglo-saxon as in the other germanic dialects we cannot say how frequently the kennings in beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same soil </s>
<s> but we can say that since a writing poet with leisure before him would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and substantial circumlocution the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition </s>
<s> one of the greatest homerists of our time frederick m combellack argues that when it is assumed the iliad and the odyssey are oral poems the postulated single redactor called homer cannot be either credited with or denied originality in choice of phrasing </s>
<s> any example of grand or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown fellow-craftsmen </s>
<s> the quest of the historical homer is likely never to have further success </s>
<s> no individual word in the iliad or the odyssey can be credited to any one man </s>
<s> no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before christ </s>
<s> this observation is of interest not only to students of homeric poetry but to students of anglo-saxon poetry as well </s>
<s> to the extent that a tale is twice told its final author must be suspect although plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the standard modus dicendi </s>
<s> combellack argues further and here he makes his main point that once the iliad and the odyssey are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they previously found arable </s>
<s> with a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its context because each was very probably the only expression that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow </s>
<s> words or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable time-servers sometimes accurate and sometimes not </s>
<s> this observation too may have reference to anglo-saxon poetry </s>
<s> to the extent that a language is formulaic its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other cliches </s>
<s> w f bryan suggests that certain kennings in beowulf were selected sometimes for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness but such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language of beowulf is formulaic </s>
<s> if the master of scops who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of speech elements </s>
<s> once many significant phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for prosodic necessity they are not to be defended for their semantic properties in isolated contexts </s>
<s> it is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of beowulf such effects as intentional irony </s>
<s> a formulaic element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection </s>
<s> time-servers though the periphrastic expressions are they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous </s>
<s> a long evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually accurate </s>
<s> true we do not know how they were regarded in their day but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read germanic or homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases </s>
<s> nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce </s>
<s> in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation </s>
<s> reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem </s>
<s> no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of heorot or the palace of priam </s>
<s> a ship at dry-dock could be called a foamy-necked floater in anglo-saxon or a swift ship in greek </s>
<s> achilles like siegfried in the nibelungenlied is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly be called swift-footed even when he stands idle </s>
<s> the epic language was not entirely the servant of the poet </s>
<s> it was partly his master </s>
<s> the language however is a proper object of scrutiny and the effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable </s>
<s> beowulf and the homeric poems appear oral compositions </s>
<s> yet they are written </s>
<s> at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed </s>
<s> albert b lord suggests that the homeric poems were dictated to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his guild and magoun argues that the beowulf poet and cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion </s>
<s> this explanation is attractive but is vitiated at least in part by the observation that cynewulf though he used kennings in the traditional manner was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes into his works </s>
<s> if cynewulf was literate the beowulf poet may have been also and so may the final redactor of the iliad and the odyssey </s>
<s> in lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate bard one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry recited and became intimately familiar with the established aids to poetizing and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of the compositions of the past </s>
<s> other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory beowulf may contain a design for terror and the iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering to a ceramic pattern produced during the geometric period in pottery </s>
<s> the account of the growth and final transcription of these epics rests partly however upon the degree to which they were formulaic </s>
<s> thus one line in five from the iliad and the odyssey is to be found somewhere else in the two poems </s>
<s> anglo-saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition </s>
<s> there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his homeric colleague </s>
<s> in determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle however to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs </s>
<s> the closest scrutiny is owed to the anglo-saxon kennings and the homeric epithets </s>

<s> this low bod was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during this study </s>
<s> microscopic examination </s>
<s> routine microscopic examinations were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by mckinney and gram for the various types of protozoa </s>
<s> it was found that the aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation pond </s>
<s> at no time were algae found in the mixed liquor </s>
<s> the bacteria formed typical activated sludge floc </s>
<s> the floc particles were all small as the heavier floc settled out </s>
<s> initially the flagellated protozoa predominated but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated protozoa </s>
<s> as the temperature decreased the number of free swimming ciliated protozoa decreased </s>
<s> but as the temperature rose the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly </s>
<s> only once were stalked ciliates found in the mixed liquor </s>
<s> the predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa is indicative of a high bacterial population </s>
<s> oxygen transfer </s>
<s> one of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator </s>
<s> routine determinations were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates </s>
<s> an extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water </s>
<s> the added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity </s>
<s> it was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen </s>
<s> a series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate </s>
<s> five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover </s>
<s> oxidation pond </s>
<s> during this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted </s>
<s> shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium nitrate </s>
<s> the location of the oxidation pond in a high-value residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer </s>
<s> microscopic examination of the effluent showed that minimum bod occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather </s>
<s> when the algae began to build up again the effluent bod rose </s>
<s> thus the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping defense of naval forces and area defense </s>
<s> the last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases </s>
<s> surface forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations air to furnish area surveillance and mines for protection of limited areas </s>
<s> submarines and shore installations are new elements </s>
<s> the submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas </s>
<s> fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection </s>
<s> mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets </s>
<s> a sixth element not always considered is intelligence </s>
<s> it includes operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment </s>
<s> operational intelligence presumably will be available from our national intelligence agencies </s>
<s> intelligence on the environment will come from the recently augmented program in oceanography </s>
<s> the major postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting </s>
<s> necessity for an over-all concept </s>
<s> thinking on submarine defense has not always been clear-cut </s>
<s> proponents of single elements tend to ensure predominance of that element without determining if it is justified and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents has assumed the greatest importance </s>
<s> consequently air surface and submarine elements overshadow the mine fixed installations and intelligence </s>
<s> these have sought more and more of what they have </s>
<s> each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others </s>
<s> this despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting </s>
<s> thus the most productive areas are not necessarily the most stressed </s>
<s> this is stated to emphasize the necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense one which would provide positions of relative importance to asw elements based on projected potentialities </s>
<s> then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective </s>
<s> an over-all concept would have other advantages </s>
<s> it would allow presentation to the public of a unified approach </s>
<s> now the problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily </s>
<s> while one element is announcing progress another is delineating its problems </s>
<s> the result can only be confusion in the public mind </s>
<s> a unified concept can serve as a guide to budgeting and if public support is gained will command congressional support </s>
<s> lacking guidance industry picks its own areas </s>
<s> the result coupled with the salesmanship for which american industry is famous is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas </s>
<s> an over-all concept will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield greatest dividends </s>
<s> principles involved in an over-all concept </s>
<s> that which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare </s>
<s> russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world divided between her various fleets </s>
<s> some are also in albania and others are on loan to egypt </s>
<s> other countries which may willingly or unwillingly become communist can furnish bases </s>
<s> communist target areas can be assumed but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with soviet intentions </s>
<s> attack can come from almost any direction against many locations </s>
<s> logically then the first principle of the plan must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area </s>
<s> it is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building at bases in transit and on station </s>
<s> in transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an overt act </s>
<s> the communists are adept at utilizing hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage </s>
<s> therefore the second principle of the plan must be that while providing for all-out hostilities its effectiveness is not dependent on general war </s>
<s> antisubmarine warfare does not involve clashes between large opposing forces with the decision a result of a single battle </s>
<s> it is a war of attrition of single actions of an exchange of losses </s>
<s> this exchange must result in our ending up with some effective units </s>
<s> therefore the third principle of the plan must be that it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types unless at an assured favorable exchange rate </s>
<s> its speed has increased it operates at increasingly greater depths its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited and it will become even more silent </s>
<s> the next developments will probably be in weaponry </s>
<s> the missile can gradually be expected to replace the torpedo </s>
<s> as detection ranges increase weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges </s>
<s> therefore the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent </s>
<s> no element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense </s>
<s> some elements support the others but all have limitations </s>
<s> some limitations of one element can be compensated for by a capability of another </s>
<s> elements used in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements </s>
<s> conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces </s>
<s> numbers would be astronomical and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution </s>
<s> shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything </s>
<s> therefore any measures taken in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when hostilities occur </s>
<s> therefore the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements </s>
<s> the world is constantly changing </s>
<s> what was new yesterday is obsolescent today </s>
<s> the seventh principle of the plan is self-evident </s>
<s> it must be flexible enough to allow for technological breakthroughs scientific progress and changes in world conditions </s>
<s> supporting elements in asw operations </s>
<s> to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated the mission has been stated broad principles delineating its content laid down and the supporting elements listed </s>
<s> before considering these elements in more detail an additional requirement should be stated </s>
<s> large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks </s>
<s> therefore because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required the plan should provide for expanding area coverage </s>
<s> but it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically </s>
<s> since effective area coverage appears fairly remote the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements air surface sub-surface fixed installations mines and intelligence </s>
<s> these are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result </s>
<s> intelligence as used herein will include information on possible opponents and on the environment which can affect operations </s>
<s> these can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence </s>
<s> in submarine defense these must have maximum stress </s>
<s> good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning greatly reduce force requirements and increase tactical effectiveness </s>
<s> environmental intelligence is just as important </s>
<s> the ocean presently co-operates with the target </s>
<s> full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the environment to our side resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics a decrease in enemy capabilities and the development of methods of capitalizing on the environment </s>
<s> therefore improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and as it supports all other elements rates a top priority </s>
<s> gathering intelligence is important but of equal importance is its translation into usable form </s>
<s> a program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic research into tactical and operating instructions </s>
<s> approaching this problem on a statistical basis is invalid because the opponent has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions but under the conditions most advantageous to him </s>
<s> therefore the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions in the area at the time of encounter </s>
<s> all capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then </s>
<s> temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and animal life are the chief environmental variables </s>
<s> there may be others </s>
<s> variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature because more of the variables would be encompassed </s>
<s> these variations must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically </s>
<s> progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information </s>
<s> a concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on the spot </s>
<s> mine warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets </s>
<s> by its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater counter-efforts </s>
<s> mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets </s>
<s> they are still considered to be for use in restricted waters however and targets must come within a few yards of them </s>
<s> mines need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment extended to deep water and have their effective area per unit increased </s>
<s> mines can be used to deny access to great areas </s>
<s> they are difficult to counter cost little to maintain until required and can be put into place quickly </s>
<s> a most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package </s>
<s> effective employment will reduce force requirements </s>
<s> for example effective mine barriers from florida to cuba and across the yucatan channel from cuba to mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense inshore patrol convoy escort shipping control and mine defense for the entire gulf of mexico </s>
<s> more extended systems covering all passage into the caribbean would free the caribbean and the gulf of mexico from the previously listed requirements </s>
<s> systems covering the gulf of st lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the united states are not impossible </s>
<s> such mine defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase in the probability of success </s>
<s> the advantages inherent in mine warfare justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any of the other elements </s>
<s> fixed installations are increasingly advocated as the problem of area defense emerges </s>
<s> the proponents are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military counterparts </s>
<s> mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target </s>
<s> such systems are expensive and are oriented geographically </s>
<s> in an over-all asw concept dependence on and effort expended for such systems should be limited to those with proven capabilities </s>
<s> no general installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined </s>
<s> in addition proposals for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile system </s>
<s> fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems </s>
<s> the submarine has become increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system </s>
<s> but the submarine is a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed </s>
<s> fragment a has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt and free base </s>
<s> chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation of kg untch </s>
<s> one of the most interesting findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to rare earth ions </s>
<s> the inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect of rare earth salts </s>
<s> various metal ions have been found to protect plasma arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine </s>
<s> the effects can be related to the structure of this enzyme </s>
<s> the non-identity of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established </s>
<s> selective inhibitors can distinguish the two activities </s>
<s> investigations on the acceleration of human plasma cholinesterase were carried further </s>
<s> this unusual collagen also was shown to undergo a reversible thermal phase transformation </s>
<s> substance z an active urinary peptide was purified by extraction in organic solvents and repeated column chromatography </s>
<s> high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography were used in preliminary structural studies </s>
<s> pharmacological effects in vitro on isolated surviving organs and in vivo on blood pressure were assayed </s>
<s> and enzymes which terminate the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps substance z were studied </s>

<s> in addition to the known principal globulin excelsin three other ultracentrifugally distinct components have been observed </s>
<s> continuum mechanics and viscoelasticity </s>
<s> theory of non-newtonian fluids </s>
<s> by strengthening the differentiability assumption it has been possible to derive second and higher order theories of viscoelasticity </s>
<s> in the second-order theory one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the first-order stress relaxation function </s>
<s> as many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered isothermally </s>
<s> the simple time-temperature equivalence valid for many amorphous systems did not hold here </s>
<s> it was possible however to decompose the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two viscoelastic mechanisms each compatible with the boltzmann superposition principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence factors </s>

<s> this glass is probably formed from libyan desert sands by comet or stony-meteorite impact </s>
<s> nickel-iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy to produce large terrestrial explosion craters may nevertheless melt only small quantities of material </s>
<s> most of the impact energy is spent in crushing and fragmentation </s>
<s> when rapid quenching follows melting impact glasses may result </s>
<s> these always contain metallic inclusions </s>
<s> impact glasses not containing elemental nickel-iron may have been produced by stony meteorites or comets </s>
<s> no meteorites have ever been recovered from paleoexplosion craters and recent craters containing impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception of aouelloul crater adrar western sahara desert </s>
<s> this crater contains impact glass with no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic material has been recovered </s>
<s> inorganic chemistry </s>
<s> preparation of a coordination compound is often accomplished by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with a ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol </s>
<s> by applying this general principle a great number of complex compounds of osmium ruthenium iridium and rhenium with triphenylphosphine triphenylarsine and triphenylstibine have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few years </s>
<s> recent work with radiocarbon and deuterated alcohols as solvents however has given evidence that metal-hydrido and carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction with alcohol in some of these systems </s>
<s> particular interest is directed towards the condensation of these ligands with metal halides to form substituted phosphide or arside complexes </s>
<s> the structures properties and reactions of these compounds are being studied </s>
<s> in another study chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides and related species prepared homogeneously by high-temperature hydrolysis are being characterized and investigated spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view to identification and semiquantitative estimation of the phases formed under varying preparative conditions </s>

<s> in continuation of these theoretical studies a more precise elucidation of the effects of imperfections in network structure is sought </s>
<s> the mean-square end-to-end distance of the polyisobutylene chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement with values deduced from viscosity data </s>
<s> these studies are being extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the hindrances to rotation around chain bonds </s>
<s> only uninterrupted sequences of the former are eligible for formation of crystallites </s>
<s> limitations on the lengths of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short crystallites which can be formed and this is reflected in a broadening of the melting range </s>
<s> the complex morphology of polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor </s>
<s> hence the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations in the latter field </s>
<s> contraction of muscle </s>
<s> experiments carried out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of several degrees centigrade and to a concentration range of only several per cent </s>
<s> the contraction therefore partakes of the character of a phase transition </s>
<s> while atp appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction </s>
<s> a simple process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed </s>
<s> the preparation of such products is not new but the systems heretofore employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental skill and starting materials of a high purity </s>

<s> because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration fermentation salting chemical treatment canning refrigeration and freezing </s>
<s> the basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption </s>
<s> in earlier years the preservation of food was essentially related to survival </s>
<s> with the development of nuclear technology isotopic materials and machine radiation sources in recent years the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the united states and throughout the world </s>
<s> an early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled </s>
<s> interest remained however in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations </s>
<s> factors responsible for the spoilage of foods </s>
<s> microorganisms are often responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods </s>
<s> of special concern is the growth of bacteria such as clostridium botulinum which generate poisonous products </s>
<s> enzymatic action in stored food produces changes which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability </s>
<s> spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with its environment as in corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with oxygen in the air to produce rancidity </s>
<s> sprouting is a naturally occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes onions carrots beets and similar root vegetables </s>
<s> insect infestation is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain </s>
<s> the presence of parasitic organisms such as trichinella spiralis in pork introduces another factor which must be dealt with in food processing </s>
<s> to permit the storage of food for long periods of time a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic action </s>
<s> food treated in this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without refrigeration </s>
<s> less severe thermal treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes </s>
<s> general effects of ionizing radiation </s>
<s> ionizing radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage or at lower doses can inhibit their action </s>
<s> it furnishes a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic organisms present in meats </s>
<s> because of undesirable flavors odors colors and generally low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching </s>
<s> radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food </s>
<s> it will however inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables </s>
<s> for radiopasteurization to partially destroy microorganisms </s>
<s> preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side effects particularly at the higher radiation dosages </s>
<s> in this respect the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized foods has to date been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods </s>
<s> a number of foods are quite acceptable as regards taste and palatability however at dosages substantially less than sterilization levels </s>
<s> moreover the nutritive value of irradiated foods apparently undergoes little if any change although some of the fat-soluble vitamins are affected by sterilization doses </s>
<s> radiation sources </s>
<s> for irradiation of food the results obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation and x-ray gamma and high-energy electron radiation are suitable </s>
<s> aside from availability and economic considerations each has certain practical advantages </s>
<s> for example gamma rays give deeper penetration but cannot be focused or collimated whereas unidirectional electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be irradiated </s>
<s> selection of a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factors including required dose rate load factor throughput convenience safety and most important costs </s>
<s> of the various particle accelerators the van de graff machines resonant transformers and linear accelerators are the principal ones available for commercial use </s>
<s> costs of the effective energy produced by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation processes </s>
<s> conventional energy for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per kwhr for process steam </s>
<s> no comparable reductions in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen </s>
<s> such projections however appear highly speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond those foreseen for food-preservation facilities </s>
<s> because agricultural activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest of many foods are widely scattered geographically and because of the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location the use of large central processing stations where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt range might be utilized is inherently impracticable </s>
<s> present status of irradiation preservation of foods </s>
<s> the objective of complete sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time </s>
<s> chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military services </s>
<s> for them providing appetizing food under battle or emergency conditions is a paramount consideration </s>
<s> they require completely sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration preferably items already cooked and ready to eat </s>
<s> high nutritional value variety palatability and appetizing appearance are important for reasons of morale </s>
<s> foods for rear stations which require cooking but no refrigeration are also of interest </s>
<s> of primary interest are meats </s>
<s> radiopasteurization which produces fewer adverse sensory changes in food products has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items </s>
<s> thus food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak freshness and palatability </s>
<s> commercial interest is chiefly in this type of treatment as is military interest under peacetime conditions </s>
<s> the present status of food preservation by ionizing radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs </s>
<s> meats </s>
<s> the radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation </s>
<s> to date the one meat showing favorable results at sterilization doses is pork </s>
<s> of particular interest to the military services is the demonstration that roast pork after radiosterilization is superior in palatability to available canned pork products </s>
<s> tests with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development of off-flavors </s>
<s> partly because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes before radiosterilization treated fresh meats have the appearance of boiled or canned meat </s>
<s> off-flavor is a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meats but problems of commercial acceptability remain </s>
<s> however the problem of consumer acceptability remains </s>
<s> the preradiation blanching process discolors the treated beef and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts </s>
<s> cooked beef irradiated in the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color </s>
<s> when lamb and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses the meat becomes dehydrated the fat becomes chalky and again unnatural changes in color occur </s>
<s> ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities </s>
<s> however a major problem here is one of scale of processing </s>
<s> ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local level whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities </s>
<s> the problems of color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are the same as for solid cuts </s>
<s> the principal potential advantage would be that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being frozen </s>
<s> a refrigerated item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type </s>
<s> competitive processes for preserving meats are by canning and freezing </s>
<s> irradiation using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator </s>
<s> poultry </s>
<s> results of irradiation tests with poultry have been quite successful </s>
<s> at sterilizing doses good palatability results with a minimum of changes in appearance taste and odor </s>
<s> acceptable taste and odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken </s>
<s> seafood </s>
<s> fresh seafood products are extremely perishable </s>
<s> although refrigeration has served to extend the storage life of these products substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately </s>
<s> furthermore it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible </s>
<s> the force required to accomplish removal is plotted by means of an electronic recorder against distance of removal </s>
<s> since the removal force is a function of coating thickness a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness </s>
<s> this too is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut </s>
<s> a number of adjustment features are included in the hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals glass wood and plastic surfaces </s>
<s> the measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out </s>
<s> hesiometer results have been found to compare excellently with manual knife scratching tests </s>
<s> if a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating </s>
<s> as the coating becomes thicker the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure </s>
<s> if the coating becomes still thicker a peeling type failure finally can occur </s>
<s> the molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface </s>
<s> here h is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and t is the film thickness </s>
<s> it can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal </s>
<s> also it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature </s>
<s> it should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness </s>
<s> presumably the interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case </s>
<s> cutting mechanism of cohesive failure </s>
<s> it was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure </s>
<s> the action and reaction forces are r and af respectively and are equal and opposite in direction </s>
<s> all the other force vectors are derived from these </s>
<s> af is the force required to cut a coating of thickness t from the substrate </s>
<s> af is the shear force along the shear plane </s>
<s> af and af are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife respectively </s>
<s> af is the normal compressive force acting on the shear plane </s>
<s> af is the friction force between chip and knife surfaces and p is the normal force acting on the face of the knife </s>
<s> consequently both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process </s>
<s> it is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of r directly </s>
<s> in actual practice the values most readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force af and the shear angle aj </s>
<s> af is instrumentally determined </s>
<s> if the cutting force af is plotted against film thickness a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope af </s>
<s> blunt knife </s>
<s> one of these is the fact that the knife employed no matter how well sharpened will have a slightly rounded cutting edge </s>
<s> it can be seen that af is a constant and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife </s>
<s> the blunter the knife the higher is the value of af </s>
<s> the importance of a hard abrasion-resistant knife material like the carboloy employed in the hesiometer immediately becomes apparent </s>
<s> softer knives would blunt very rapidly making the value of af inexact </s>
<s> in extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even change during the course of a measurement </s>
<s> knife friction </s>
<s> a second factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate </s>
<s> under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust af against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of af </s>
<s> the resultant friction force af is thus directly proportional to af and consequently also to film thickness </s>
<s> the value of af can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external loadings </s>
<s> a straight line relationship is usually observed in a plot of af against load l having slope k and af </s>
<s> since the load l under actual cutting conditions is caused by af it can be seen that af </s>
<s> the measured force h in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating af that due to the bluntness of the knife af and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate af or af </s>
<s> chipping mechanism of cohesive failure </s>
<s> although a large number of coatings systems particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place </s>
<s> this is a chipping dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle coatings resins or very highly pigmented films </s>
<s> the basic difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without fracture rupture intermittently occurs along the shear plane </s>
<s> the detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied extensively by merchant for metal cutting and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings </s>
<s> in the next the shear plane angle is high and extends to the inclined work surface </s>
<s> with increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases </s>
<s> merchant has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional area are used </s>

<s> flexural strength </s>
<s> this term refers to the ability of a material to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by bending </s>

<s> processing urethanes </s>
<s> there are many ways of producing a foamed urethane product </s>

<s> slab stock is still one of the most important forms of urethane end-product in use today </s>
<s> basically the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units a variable mixer a nozzle carriage assembly and in many cases a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it solidifies into foam </s>

<s> the convoluted sheets can be combined to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically </s>
<s> the low cost and ease of fabrication of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes dimensions and contours that can be tailor-made to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case liners materials handling containers packaging and cushioning devices and such novelties as soap dishes toys head rests arch supports and gas pedal covers </s>
<s> molding </s>
<s> although slab stock appeared first it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with irregular shapes crowned contours or rounded edges the cutting of slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process </s>
<s> only by resorting to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market </s>
<s> satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether foams were never fully achieved </s>
<s> this counteracted the gain from having no scrap loss </s>
<s> in addition there were difficulties with the flow and spreading of the foam mixture over the mold surface trouble with lack of gel strength in the rising foam and problems of splits </s>
<s> the introduction of one-shot polyether foam systems aided by the development of new catalysts helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding </s>
<s> while there are still many bugs to be ironed out the technique is fast developing </s>
<s> other techniques </s>
<s> simple systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured pumped etc into a void where they foam up to fill the void </s>
<s> during the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins </s>
<s> when all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs </s>

<s> principle </s>
<s> a specimen or garment is washed in a cylindrical reversing wash wheel dried and subjected to restorative forces where necessary </s>
<s> temperature and time of agitation in the wash wheel are varied to obtain different degrees of severity </s>
<s> drying procedures and application of restorative force procedures are varied to conform with end-use handling during home or commercial laundering </s>
<s> apparatus and materials </s>
<s> there are three fins each approximately three inches wide extending the full length of the inside of the wheel </s>
<s> the water inlets are large enough to permit filling the wheel to an eight-inch level in less than two minutes and the outlet is large enough to permit discharge of this same amount of water in less than two minutes </s>
<s> the machine shall contain an opening for the insertion of a thermometer or other equivalent equipment for determining the temperature of the water during the washing and rinsing procedures </s>
<s> it is equipped with an outside water gauge that will indicate the level of the water in the wheel </s>
<s> a domestic automatic washer that will give equivalent results may be used </s>
<s> the wash wheel is the equipment preferred for the test </s>
<s> two of the clamps are fixed to the edges of the board whereas two clamps travel on guide rails opposite the fixed clamps </s>
<s> the movable clamps travel on carriages which ride the rails and are drawn by dead-weight loading </s>
<s> a perforated aluminum plate used to provide the drying surface is heated by means of a flatiron </s>
<s> each pin is individually sprung to a tensioning member which is driven outwardly in the slot </s>
<s> the tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the plane of the test specimen </s>
<s> the surface of the apparatus in contact with the test specimen is uncluttered and polished so as to be as friction-free as possible </s>
<s> test specimens </s>
<s> three specimens for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory average of performance </s>
<s> this is especially true for knitted fabrics </s>
<s> specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with a standard atmosphere of af and af and then laid out without tension on a flat polished surface care being taken that the fabric is free from wrinkles or creases </s>
<s> fabrics that are badly distorted in their unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional change results when laundered by any procedure </s>
<s> this also holds true if restorative forces are applied </s>
<s> therefore it is recommended that in such cases the sample be replaced or if used the results of dimensional change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative only </s>
<s> the distances may be marked with indelible ink and a fine-point pen by sewing fine threads into the fabric or by a specially designed stamping machine </s>
<s> the marked distances are parallel to the respective yarns </s>
<s> usually the greater the original distances marked the greater will be the accuracy of the test </s>

<s> high-gain photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicability </s>
<s> high-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods </s>
<s> cascading of single stages enclosed in one common envelope </s>
<s> cascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely </s>
<s> channel-type image intensifiers are capable of achieving high-gain values </s>
<s> they suffer however from an inherently low resolution </s>
<s> image intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned </s>
<s> however the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain </s>
<s> tsem tubes have been constructed showing high gain and resolution </s>
<s> however electrostatic focus important for many applications has not been realized for these devices </s>
<s> resolution limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to chromatic aberrations </s>
<s> furthermore the thin film dynodes appear to have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be tolerated </s>
<s> cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope have been constructed with high gain and high resolution </s>
<s> these tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members </s>
<s> the electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one </s>
<s> the magnification may be smaller equal or larger than unity </s>
<s> as it will be discussed later peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing curved fiber couplers </s>
<s> it should be noted however that the paraxial resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems </s>
<s> therefore we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such tubes </s>

<s> the effect of device and quantum noise associated with such low input levels will be described </s>
<s> after these theoretical considerations constructional details of a fiber-coupled double-stage x-ray image intensifier will be discussed </s>
<s> measured performance characteristics for this experimental tube will be listed </s>
<s> the conclusion shall be reached that fiber-coupled double-stage tubes represent a sensible and practical approach to high-gain image intensification </s>
<s> basic design of a fiber-coupled double-stage image intensifier </s>
<s> the tube design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be described now </s>
<s> the cylindrical focusing electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the focusing potential </s>
<s> the anode potential codetermines the gain g and magnification m of the stage </s>
<s> both the photocathode and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved concave as seen from the anode aperture </s>
<s> the field-flattening property of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or coupling member </s>
<s> for the same reason the output fiber plate is planoconcave its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent record is desired </s>
<s> as it will be shown later the field-flattening properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design </s>
<s> the second photocathode and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates </s>
<s> both stages are assumed to have unity magnification </s>
<s> theoretical discussion of flux gain </s>
<s> flux gain of a single stage </s>
<s> in general p is a function of v and the current density but it shall here be assumed as a constant </s>
<s> the luminous efficiency af of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant sensitivity af and on the spectral distribution of the incident light af by the relation af where af is normalized radiant photocathode sensitivity </s>
<s> af is standard visibility function </s>
<s> the luminous flux gain of a single stage is given by af </s>
<s> if the input light distribution falls beyond the visible range af as expected since af </s>
<s> such cases are not considered here </s>
<s> efficiency of fiber couplers </s>
<s> the numerical aperture of the fibers is given by af where af </s>
<s> the angle af is measured in the medium of index af </s>
<s> settled phosphors as generally used in image intensifiers have low optical contact with the substrate surface hence af shall be assumed </s>
<s> the numerical aperture should be in general close to unity </s>
<s> this condition can be satisfied eg with af and af or equivalent glass combinations </s>
<s> a sufficiently good approximation for determining the end reflection losses r can be obtained from the angle independent fresnel formula af </s>
<s> for phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces and assuming af we obtain af percent </s>
<s> hence the af factor for the output fiber coupler is af </s>
<s> it might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further </s>
<s> the internal losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to deviations from the prescribed cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute imperfections of the core-jacket interface </s>
<s> these losses depend on fiber diameter and length absorption coefficient the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last but not least on the angular distribution of the incident light </s>
<s> this relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber diameters increasing the number of internal reflections </s>
<s> the packing efficiency fr of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used until rather recently </s>
<s> the efficiency af of an af lens at the magnification af is af </s>
<s> gain of fiber coupled image intensifiers </s>
<s> including the brightness gain af due to the af area demagnification the overall gain of a fiber coupled double stage image intensifier is af </s>
<s> theoretical discussion of paraxial device resolution </s>
<s> resolution limitations in a single stage </s>
<s> the resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing screen </s>
<s> the resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations </s>
<s> it has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity magnification </s>
<s> furthermore the chromatic aberrations depend on the chosen high voltage </s>
<s> in general a high anode voltage reduces chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution </s>
<s> the following efficiencies obtained from jedec and rca specifications were used af </s>
<s> the possibility of a space charge blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has been pointed out </s>
<s> it is obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output levels </s>
<s> space charge influences will also decrease at increased voltages </s>
<s> electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography </s>
<s> thus in general elementary light optical effects light scatter and electron scatter determine the obtainable resolution limit </s>
<s> the set of all decisions is called the operating policy or more simply the policy </s>
<s> an optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product </s>
<s> the specification of the state of the process stream </s>
<s> the specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect </s>
<s> the specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired </s>
<s> for a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species and the temperature or pressure of the stream </s>
<s> for the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied </s>
<s> the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter </s>
<s> the objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing </s>
<s> the essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by bellman </s>
<s> he recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an r-stage process the remaining stages must use an optimal af-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process </s>
<s> moreover by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal af-stage policy for the remaining stages we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all r stages </s>
<s> proceeding in this way from one to two and from two to three stages we may gradually build up the policy for any number </s>
<s> at each step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied </s>
<s> to see how important this economy is let us suppose that there are m operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by n variables </s>
<s> to proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for interpolation </s>
<s> this number will be of the order of af </s>
<s> if however we are seeking the optimal r-stage policy for a given feed state only one search for a maximum is required at the final step </s>
<s> thus a number of operations of the order of af are required </s>
<s> if all the operating variables were varied simultaneously af operations would be required to do the same job and as r increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program </s>
<s> but even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy namely that for the given feed state and r stages </s>
<s> in contrast the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages </s>
<s> if the problem is enlarged to require a complete coverage of feed states af operations are needed by the dynamic program and af by the direct search </s>
<s> but af is vastly larger than r </s>
<s> no optimism is more baseless than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the crudest of methods in searching out a result </s>
<s> suppose that af and that the average operation requires only af sec </s>
<s> then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three millennia </s>
<s> the principle of optimality thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a multistage decision process </s>
<s> this is the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation </s>
<s> it appears in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital computer </s>
<s> at the same time every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end </s>
<s> these will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream so that stage r is the t stage from the end </s>
<s> let the state of the stream leaving stage r be denoted by a vector af and the operating variables of stage r by af </s>
<s> thus af denotes the state of the feed to the r-stage process and af the state of the product from the last stage </s>
<s> each stage transforms the state af of its feed to the state af in a way that depends on the operating variables af </s>
<s> we write this af </s>
<s> this transformation is uniquely determined by af and we therefore speak of the process as deterministic </s>
<s> in practical situations there will be restrictions on the admissible operating conditions and we regard the vectors as belonging to a fixed and bounded set s </s>
<s> the set of vectors af constitutes the operating policy or more briefly the policy and a policy is admissible if all the af belong to s </s>
<s> thus af </s>
<s> the objective function which is to be maximized is some function usually piecewise continuous of the product state </s>
<s> let this be denoted by af </s>
<s> an optimal policy is an admissible policy af which maximizes the objective function p </s>
<s> let af where the maximization is over all admissible policies af </s>
<s> when it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal r-stage policy with respect to the feed state af </s>
<s> for any choice of admissible policy af in the first stage the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by af </s>
<s> this is the feed state of the subsequent af stages which according to the principle of optimality must use an optimal af-stage policy with respect to this state </s>
<s> this will result in a value af of the objective function and when af is chosen correctly this will give af the maximum of the objective function </s>
<s> in finding the optimal r-stage policy from that of af stages only the function af is needed </s>
<s> when af has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of af and the whole calculation repeated </s>
<s> we also see how the results may be presented although if n the number of state variables is large any tabulation will become cumbersome </s>
<s> to extract the optimal r-stage policy with respect to the feed state af we enter section r of this table at the state af and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function </s>
<s> in the third column is given the optimal policy for stage r and in the fourth the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used </s>
<s> since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an optimal af-stage policy with respect to af we may enter section af of the table at this state af and read off the optimal policy for stage af and the resulting state af </s>
<s> proceeding in this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and if it is desired we can check on af by evaluating af at the last stage </s>
<s> it may be that the objective function depends not only on af but also on af as when the cost of the operating policy is considered </s>
<s> a form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is af </s>
<s> here p represents the value of the stream in state p and q the cost of operating the stage with conditions q </s>
<s> hence p is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation that is the net profit </s>
<s> if af denotes the net profit from stage r and af then the principle of optimality gives af </s>
<s> this sequence of equations may be started with the remark that with no process af there is no profit ie af </s>
<s> the process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only statistically is also of interest although for chemical reactor design it is not as important as the deterministic process </s>
<s> in this case the stage r operating with conditions af transforms the state of the stream from af to af but only the probability distribution of af is known </s>
<s> this is specified by a distribution function af such that the probability that af lies in some region d of the stage space is af </s>
<s> we cannot now speak of maximizing the value of the objective function since this function is now known only in a probabilistic sense </s>
<s> we can however maximize its expected value </s>
<s> for a single stage we may define af where the maximization is by choice of af </s>
<s> we thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected value of the objective function for a given af </s>
<s> if we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first </s>
<s> then af the maximization being over all admissible af and the integration over the whole of stage space </s>
<s> the type of presentation of results used in the deterministic process may be used here except that now the fourth column is redundant </s>
<s> the third column gives the optimal policy but we must wait to see the outcome of stage r and enter the preceding section of the table at this state </s>
<s> the discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter </s>
<s> in many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process </s>
<s> the word distance is used here in a rather general sense </s>
<s> it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process </s>
<s> p denotes the state at any point t and q the vector of operating variables there </s>
<s> a gyro-stabilized platform system using restrained gyros is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination </s>
<s> the restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion neglecting transient effects as follows af where u is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro </s>
<s> the gyro angular momentum is defined by h </s>
<s> it is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes </s>
<s> if the polarities are correct the platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero </s>
<s> as the accelerometer output is decreasing the torque applied to the gyro output axis decreases and therefore the rate decreases </s>
<s> finally when the accelerometer output is zero the entire system remains stationary and the platform is by definition leveled </s>
<s> the platform is initially off level by the angle aj </s>
<s> the voltage af is amplified by af and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor af </s>
<s> finally the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by af </s>
<s> with these factors included an upper limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations </s>
<s> in this type of system a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time </s>
<s> when the frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain </s>
<s> the time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain </s>
<s> in addition the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional to the servo loop gain </s>
<s> ie high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations </s>
<s> this problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time </s>
<s> the equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is af </s>
<s> in practice the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe </s>
<s> when the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers </s>
<s> there are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts engine noise turbulence around the vehicle etc </s>
<s> one of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level acceleration noise </s>
<s> one solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters </s>
<s> this technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt </s>
<s> since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering increases the response time a practical compromise must be reached </s>
<s> one of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a non-linear amplifier for af </s>
<s> the amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level </s>
<s> below this level the amplifier gain af is proportional and is of small value in order to provide adequate noise filtering </s>
<s> the effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process </s>
<s> the platform actually tilts off level so that the accelerometer output when amplified by af will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift </s>
<s> the amount of platform dip required depends upon the scale factors of the system </s>
<s> practical leveling considerations </s>
<s> the automatic leveling system described in this section is readily adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating gyros </s>
<s> the system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits </s>
<s> however the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform </s>
<s> this leveling system will hold the platform on-level automatically as long as the system is actuated </s>
<s> a useful by-product of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level </s>
<s> the leveling process can be accomplished manually and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment </s>
<s> the process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs of both accelerometers are zero </s>
<s> the turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro torquers described above </s>
<s> manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs </s>
<s> however skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy </s>
<s> also it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach </s>
<s> manual leveling is inconvenient if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time </s>
<s> the operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift is canceled </s>
<s> this process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random </s>
<s> platform heading </s>
<s> platform heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator </s>
<s> in simpler terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction </s>
<s> for purely inertial navigators two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading </s>
<s> use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading </s>
<s> the choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements field conditions and the time available to accomplish the heading </s>
<s> with the gyro-stabilized platform leveled it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques </s>
<s> the platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure </s>
<s> before the accelerometers are mounted on the platform the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined </s>
<s> a mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit </s>
<s> transit </s>
<s> a precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north </s>
<s> this can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques </s>
<s> with the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometers is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned </s>
<s> the sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to project a beam of light which is darkened by crossed hairs on the accelerometer mirror </s>
<s> when the platform is aligned the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original crossed hairs </s>
<s> the images can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy </s>
<s> the platform is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro torquers </s>
<s> although this technique is simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty does exist the direction of true north must be known for each launch point </s>
<s> however this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few days work </s>
<s> in many installations the inertial platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight </s>
<s> with this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment </s>
<s> if the platform is not too high off the ground a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform </s>
<s> obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand </s>
<s> autocollimator </s>
<s> the transit can be replaced by an autocollimator </s>
<s> this instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading </s>
<s> the electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified and supplied to the z-gyro torquer </s>
<s> if the polarity is correct the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero </s>
<s> information is also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the z-axis gyro </s>
<s> if the z gyro is drifting a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift </s>
<s> if the drift error is systematic it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required compensating current </s>
<s> electrical pickoffs </s>
<s> it is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform </s>
<s> essentially the stator or reference portion of the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero </s>
<s> gyrocompass heading </s>
<s> gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading </s>
<s> for the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of three restrained gyros a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the x accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction at the base point and the y accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point </s>
<s> the accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform </s>
<s> thus if one accelerometer is properly aligned the other is also </s>
<s> the input axis of the appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers </s>
<s> the platform is leveled and properly headed so that the x-gyro input axis is parallel to the east-west direction and the y-gyro input axis is parallel to the north-south direction </s>
<s> the input axis of the x gyro when pointing in the east-west direction is always perpendicular to the spin axis of earth </s>
<s> the sensing of this rotation by the x gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading </s>

<s> the characteristic thing about this church was its amen corner and the weekly religious orgy </s>
<s> a knot of old worshippers chiefly women listened weekly to a sermon </s>
<s> it began invariably in low tones almost conversational and then gradually worked up to high shrill appeals to god and man </s>
<s> and then the amen corner took hold re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the greek chorus spreading down through the african forest overseas to the west indies and then here in alabama </s>
<s> with shout and slow dance with tears and song with scream and contortion the corner group was beset by hysteria and shivering wailing shouting possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force </s>
<s> it spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed negro religion </s>
<s> it sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor </s>
<s> to most of those who composed the amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience something for which they lived from week to week </s>
<s> it was often re-enacted in less wild form at the wednesday night prayer meeting </s>
<s> wilson on his first sunday witnessed this with something like disgust </s>
<s> he had preached a short sermon trying to talk man-to-man to the audience to tell them who he was what he had done in macon and birmingham and what he proposed to do here </s>
<s> he sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor </s>
<s> but then at mention of that name the amen corner broke loose </s>
<s> he had no chance to say another word </s>
<s> at the very end when the audience was silent and breathless a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed out </s>
<s> the audience did not think much of the new pastor and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say </s>
<s> during the next weeks he looked over the situation </s>
<s> first of all there was the parsonage an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live in originally poorly conceived apparently not repaired for years with no plumbing or sewage with rat-holes and rot </s>
<s> it was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church a woman named catt who as wilson afterward found was briefly referred to as the cat because of her sharp tongue and fierce initiative </s>
<s> ann catt was a lonely devoted soul never married conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church but a perpetual dissenter and born critic </s>
<s> she soared over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository </s>
<s> then wilson looked over the church and studied its condition </s>
<s> the church itself must be repaired </s>
<s> it was dirty and neglected </s>
<s> it really ought to be rebuilt and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this </s>
<s> meanwhile the city itself should be talked to </s>
<s> the streets in the colored section were dirty </s>
<s> there was typhoid and malaria </s>
<s> the children had nowhere to go and no place to play not even sidewalks </s>
<s> the school was small dark and ill-equipped </s>
<s> the teacher was a pliant fool </s>
<s> there were two liquor saloons not very far from the church one white that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for negroes </s>
<s> the other exclusively negro </s>
<s> undoubtedly there was a good deal of gambling in both </s>
<s> on the other side of the church was a quiet well-kept house with shutters and recently painted </s>
<s> wilson inquired about it </s>
<s> it was called kent house </s>
<s> the deacon of the church carlson was its janitor </s>
<s> one of the leading members of the amen corner was cook </s>
<s> there were two or three colored maids employed there </s>
<s> wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people which seemed to him rather queer </s>
<s> but nevertheless it looked respectable </s>
<s> he was glad to have it there </s>
<s> the rest of black bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect disrepair and careful upkeep </s>
<s> dives carefully repaired huts and nicely painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl with little distinction </s>
<s> the best could not escape from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better </s>
<s> the yards front and back were narrow </s>
<s> some were trash dumps some had flower gardens </s>
<s> behind were privies for there was no sewage system </s>
<s> after looking about a bit wilson discovered beyond black bottom across the river and far removed from the white city a considerable tract of land and it occurred to him that the church and the better negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot </s>
<s> he talked about it to the presiding elder </s>
<s> the presiding elder looked him over rather carefully </s>
<s> he was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand </s>
<s> but there was one thing that he had to stress and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses the dollar money had been seriously falling behind in this church and that must be looked after immediately </s>
<s> wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was they must have a better church a more business-like conduct of the church organization and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization </s>
<s> he emphasized to the presiding elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river </s>
<s> the presiding elder was sure that that would be impossible </s>
<s> and wilson tried </s>
<s> it did seem impossible </s>
<s> the bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears and the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in and that none would be sold to colored folk </s>
<s> when it was proposed to rebuild the church wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high </s>
<s> he was sure that he could do better if he went to atlanta to get the deal financed </s>
<s> but when this proposal was made to his deacon board he met unanimous opposition </s>
<s> the church certainly would not be removed </s>
<s> the very proposition was sacrilege </s>
<s> it had been here fifty years </s>
<s> it was going to stay forever </s>
<s> it was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject </s>
<s> as for rebuilding well that might be looked into but there was no hurry no hurry at all </s>
<s> wilson again went downtown to a different banker an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic but he shook his head </s>
<s> tenements stores saloons some gambling i hope not too much </s>
<s> the colored people are getting employment at kent house and other places and they are near their places of employment </s>
<s> when a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them </s>
<s> now if i were you i would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years </s>
<s> and he dismissed the colored pastor </s>
<s> it was next day that sojourner came and sat beside him and took his hand </s>
<s> i was just asking about it </s>
<s> they hire a good deal of local labor including two members of our trustee board </s>
<s> wilson stared at her </s>
<s> and after wilson had talked to mrs catt and to others he was absolutely amazed </s>
<s> but it had largely disappeared on account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the part of the negroes as they became more educated and got better wages </s>
<s> but this situation of kent house was more subtle </s>
<s> the wages involved were larger and more regular </s>
<s> the inmates were white and from out of town avoiding local friction </s>
<s> the backing from the white town was greater and there was little publicity </s>
<s> good wages patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from negroes </s>
<s> and yet wilson knew that this place must go or he must go </s>
<s> and for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the methodist church if not in all churches </s>
<s> payne dismounted in madison place and handed the reins to herold </s>
<s> there was a fog which increased the darkness of the night </s>
<s> two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow </s>
<s> he might have been anywhere or nowhere </s>
<s> the pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from dr verdi </s>
<s> secretary of state seward was a sick man </s>
<s> the sick were always receiving medicines </s>
<s> no one would question such an errand </s>
<s> the bottle was filled up with flour </s>
<s> now it would have another death </s>
<s> from the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry </s>
<s> he clomped heavily up the stoop and rang the bell </s>
<s> like the bell at mass the doorbell was pitched too high </s>
<s> it was still good friday after all </s>
<s> a nigger boy opened the door </s>
<s> payne did not notice him </s>
<s> he was thinking chiefly of cap </s>
<s> if their schedules were to synchronize there was no point in wasting time </s>
<s> he pushed his way inside </s>
<s> for a moment the hall confused him </s>
<s> this was the largest house he had ever been in almost the largest building except for a hotel </s>
<s> in the half darkness the banisters gleamed and the hall seemed enormous </s>
<s> above him somewhere were the bedrooms </s>
<s> seward would be up there </s>
<s> he explained his errand but without bothering much to make it plausible for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army </s>
<s> he did not really want to kill but as in the sexual act there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be downed even while you watched yourself giving way to it </s>
<s> he was no longer worried </s>
<s> everything would be all right </s>
<s> he knew that in this mood he could not be stopped </s>
<s> still the sensation always surprised him </s>
<s> it was a thrill he felt no part in </s>
<s> he could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick appalling and efficient things </s>
<s> he brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs </s>
<s> they were carpeted but made for pumps and congress gaiters not the great clodhoppers he wore </s>
<s> the sound of his footsteps was like a muffled drum </s>
<s> at the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown </s>
<s> he stopped and whispered his errand </s>
<s> young frederick seward held out his hand </s>
<s> panting a little payne shook his head </s>
<s> dr verdi had told him to deliver his package in person </s>
<s> he smiled but now that he knew where the elder seward was he did not intend to go </s>
<s> he pulled out his pistol and fired it </s>
<s> it made no sound </s>
<s> it had misfired </s>
<s> it was the first blow that was always difficult </s>
<s> after that violence was exultantly easy </s>
<s> he got caught up into it and became a different person </s>
<s> only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless so that he would puzzle over it for days whereas at the time it had seemed quite real </s>
<s> it was not murder at all </s>
<s> payne was more methodical than that </s>
<s> he was merely clearing a way to what he had to do </s>
<s> he ran for the sick room found his pistol was broken and threw it away </s>
<s> a knife would do </s>
<s> from childhood he had known all about knives </s>
<s> someone blocked the door from inside </s>
<s> he smashed it in and tumbled into darkness </s>
<s> he saw only dimly moving figures but when he slashed them they yelled and fled </s>
<s> he went for the bed jumped on it and struck where he could repeatedly </s>
<s> two men pulled him off </s>
<s> nobody said anything </s>
<s> payne hacked at their arms </s>
<s> there was a lady there in a nightdress </s>
<s> he would not have wanted to hurt a lady </s>
<s> another man approached this one fully dressed </s>
<s> when the knife went into his chest he went down at once </s>
<s> that would have made things so much easier </s>
<s> but he was not mad </s>
<s> he was only dreaming </s>
<s> he clattered down the stairs and out of the door </s>
<s> somewhere in the fog the nigger boy was still yelling murder </s>
<s> the clammy air revived him </s>
<s> herold he saw had fled </s>
<s> well one did not expect much of people like herold </s>
<s> he unhitched his horse walked it away mounted and spurred it on </s>
<s> the nigger boy was close behind him </s>
<s> then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone </s>
<s> he rode on and on </s>
<s> he had no idea where he was </s>
<s> after some time he came to an open field </s>
<s> an open field was better than a building that was for sure so he dismounted turned off the horse and plunged through the grass </s>
<s> he felt curiously sleepy the world seemed far away </s>
<s> cap would find him and take care of him </s>
<s> so choosing a good tree he clambered up into it found a comfortable notch and curled up in it to sleep like the tousled bear he was with his hands across his chest as though surfeited with honey </s>
<s> violence always made him tired but he was not frightened </s>
<s> in boston edwin booth was winding up a performance of a new way to pay old debts </s>
<s> it was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more </s>
<s> acting soothed him </s>
<s> on a stage he always knew what to do and tonight to judge by the applause he must be doing it better than usual </s>
<s> that was one of the high spots of the play </s>
<s> the audience as usual loved it </s>
<s> he was delighted to see them so happy </s>
<s> if he had any worries it was only the small ones about mother in new york and his daughter edwina and what she might be doing at this hour with her aunt asia in philadelphia </s>
<s> everyone is ambivalent about his profession if he has practised it long enough but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there who might cheer you or boo you but that was largely though not entirely up to you </s>
<s> they made the world seem friendly somehow though he knew it was not </s>
<s> wilkes was quite right about one thing </s>
<s> laura keene had been in the green room </s>
<s> the commotion had brought her into the wings </s>
<s> since she could not act one part suited her as well as any other and so she was the first person to offer mr lincoln a glass of water holding it up to the box high above her head to miss harris who had asked for it </s>
<s> she had been one of the first to collect her wits </s>
<s> it was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience as that they had been stunned already </s>
<s> most of them had seen our american cousin before and unless miss keene was on stage there was not much to it </s>
<s> the theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom </s>
<s> the stage had been empty except for harry hawk doing his star monologue </s>
<s> the audience was fond of harry hawk he was a dear in or out of character but he was not particularly funny </s>
<s> at the end of the monologue the audience would applaud </s>
<s> meanwhile it looked at the scenery </s>
<s> said trenchard otherwise hawk </s>
<s> there was always a pause here before the next line </s>
<s> that was when the gun went off </s>
<s> yet even that explosion did not mean much </s>
<s> guns were going off all over washington city these days because of the celebrations and the theatre was not soundproof </s>
<s> then the audience saw a small dim figure appear at the edge of the presidential box </s>
<s> booth had delivered his line </s>
<s> behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke </s>
<s> they strained forward </s>
<s> they had not heard what had been said </s>
<s> they had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily </s>
<s> the figure leapt from the box almost lost its balance the flag draped there tore in the air the figure landed on its left leg fell on its hands and pressed itself up </s>
<s> harry hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings </s>
<s> his speech faltered </s>
<s> he did not lower his arm </s>
<s> the figure was so theatrically dressed that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one </s>
<s> the play for saturday night was to be a benefit performance of the octoroon </s>
<s> this figure looked like the slave dealer from that </s>
<s> but it also looked like a toad hopping away from the light </s>
<s> there was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them </s>
<s> then it disappeared into the wings </s>
<s> harry hawk had not shifted position but he at last lowered his arm </s>
<s> mrs lincoln screamed </s>
<s> there was no mistaking that scream </s>
<s> it was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do </s>
<s> yet this scream had a different note in it </s>
<s> that absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water </s>
<s> clara harris one of the guests in the box stood up and demanded water </s>
<s> her action was involuntary </s>
<s> when something unexpected happened one always asked for water if one were a woman brandy if one were a man </s>
<s> mrs lincoln screamed again </s>
<s> that got everybody up </s>
<s> on the stage harry hawk began to weep </s>
<s> laura keene brushed by him with the glass of water </s>
<s> the crowd began to move </s>
<s> in washington city everyone lived in a bubble of plots and one death might attract another </s>
<s> it was not exactly panic they gave way to but they could not just sit there </s>
<s> at the rear of the auditorium upstairs some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor </s>
<s> it would not give </s>
<s> a dr charles taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box </s>
<s> in the audience a man named ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob on the same principle which had led miss harris to demand water </s>
<s> someone opened the corridor door from the inside and called for a doctor </s>
<s> somehow dr charles leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the dingy corridor </s>
<s> he went straight to the presidential box </s>
<s> as usual mrs lincoln had lost her head but nobody blamed her for doing so now </s>
<s> rathbone said he was bleeding to death </s>
<s> with a sneer the man spread his legs and a third time confronted them </s>
<s> once more katie reared and whinnied in fear </s>
<s> for a moment boy and mount hung in midair </s>
<s> stevie twisted and frantically commanded the mare to leap straight ahead </s>
<s> but the stranger was nimbler still </s>
<s> with a bold arm he dared once more to obstruct them </s>
<s> katie reared a third time then trembling descended </s>
<s> the stranger leered </s>
<s> seizing the bridle he tugged with all his might and forced katie to her knees </s>
<s> it was absurd </s>
<s> stevie could feel himself toppling </s>
<s> with incredible ferocity he brought his fists together and struck </s>
<s> the blow encountered silky hair and hard bone </s>
<s> the man uttered a weird cry spun about and collapsed in the sand </s>
<s> katie scrambled to her feet stevie agilely retaining his seat </s>
<s> again katie reared and now wickedly he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger </s>
<s> he could feel his own feet iron-shod striking repeatedly until the body was limp </s>
<s> he gloated and his lips slavered </s>
<s> he heard himself chortling </s>
<s> they rode around and around to trample the figure into the sand </s>
<s> only the top of the head with a spot bare and white as a clamshell remained visible </s>
<s> stevie was shouting triumphantly </s>
<s> a train hooted </s>
<s> instantly he chilled </s>
<s> they were pursuing him </s>
<s> he was frightened </s>
<s> his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt </s>
<s> then katie stumbled and again he was falling falling </s>
<s> his mother was nudging him but he was still falling </s>
<s> before it was sprawled the mangled corpse of the bearded stranger </s>
<s> he had been dreaming </s>
<s> the train had slowed </s>
<s> houses winked as the cars rolled beside a little depot </s>
<s> the trainman called </s>
<s> bong </s>
<s> bong </s>
<s> startled him awake </s>
<s> the room vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it </s>
<s> bong </s>
<s> a dull boom and a throbbing echo </s>
<s> the walls bulged the floor trembled the windowpanes rattled </s>
<s> he stared at the far morning expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon </s>
<s> bong </s>
<s> he raced to the window and yanked at the sash </s>
<s> bong </s>
<s> the wood was old the paint alligatored </s>
<s> bong </s>
<s> a fresh breeze saluted him </s>
<s> he put his head out </s>
<s> there was the slate roof of the church </s>
<s> ivy climbed the red brick walls like a green-scaled monster </s>
<s> the clock which had struck presented an innocent face </s>
<s> in the kitchen mama was wiping the cupboards </s>
<s> he dressed and sped outdoors </s>
<s> he crossed broome street to orange square </s>
<s> the steeple leaned backward while the church advanced like a headless creature in a long shapeless coat </s>
<s> the spire seemed to hold up the sky </s>
<s> port jervis basking in the foothills was the city of god </s>
<s> the dutch reformed church with two steeples and its own school was on main street </s>
<s> the episcopal church was one block down sussex street </s>
<s> the catholics had the largest cemetery near the neversink river where main street ran south </s>
<s> stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds </s>
<s> god was everywhere in the belfry in the steeple in the clouds in the trees and in the mountains hulking on the horizon </s>
<s> somewhere beyond where shadows lurked must be the yawning pit of which papa preached and the dreadful lake of fire </s>
<s> so walking in awe he became familiar with god who resided chiefly in drew centennial church with its high steeple and clock </s>
<s> there was no church like drew church no preacher like papa who was intimate with him and could consign sinners to hellfire </s>
<s> he was fortunate and proud </s>
<s> although they journeyed westerly as far as germantown beyond the erie roundhouse and the machine shop and along the delaware and hudson canal and northward to brooklyn below point peter he could see the church spire wherever he looked back </s>
<s> that was pennsylvania </s>
<s> in the delaware river three long islands were overgrown with greening trees and underbrush </s>
<s> south of laurel grove cemetery and below the junction of the neversink and the delaware was the tri-state rock from which stevie could spy new jersey and pennsylvania as well as new york simply by spinning around on his heel </s>
<s> where cuddleback brook purled into the neversink was a magnificent swimming hole </s>
<s> stevie saw no idols </s>
<s> he was torn between the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters and a little engine chugging northward on the monticello branch </s>
<s> ludie inquired every evening pretending that he did not care </s>
<s> stevie flared </s>
<s> he made a will and last testament before we left paterson </s>
<s> i heard them </s>
<s> ludie could be hateful </s>
<s> to speak of papa dying was a sin </s>
<s> it could never happen as long as god was alert and the drew steeple stood guard with its peaked lance </s>
<s> stevie was constantly slipping into the church </s>
<s> he pulled with all his strength at the heavy brass-bound door and shuffled along the wainscoted wall </s>
<s> the cold mysterious presence of god was all around him </s>
<s> at the end of a shaft of light the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon </s>
<s> far away standing before a curtained window in the study room was his father hands tucked under his coattails and staring into the dark church </s>
<s> the figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence </s>
<s> the boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles and gray hair </s>
<s> the mouth was thin-lipped and wide the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide </s>
<s> perhaps one day he will choose you as he chose me long ago </s>
<s> therefore give him your affection and store up his love for you </s>
<s> open your heart to him and pray stephen pray </s>
<s> stevie had heard these words many times yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble </s>
<s> for he feared the lake of fire </s>
<s> he strove to think of god and his eternal wrath </s>
<s> he must pray to be spared </s>
<s> papa was disappointed that none of the brothers had heard the call </s>
<s> not george townley or ted certainly not ludie </s>
<s> burt was at hackettstown and will at albany law school where they surely could not hear it </s>
<s> someday god would choose him </s>
<s> he would hear the call and would run to tell papa </s>
<s> probably as in scriptures a still small voice would whisper </s>
<s> it would summon him once </s>
<s> if he missed it never again </s>
<s> he must not fail to hear it </s>
<s> when the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley he was unafraid </s>
<s> aggie might fly into a closet shut the door and bury her head in the clothes </s>
<s> he dared to wait for the lightning </s>
<s> lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner </s>
<s> but he was good </s>
<s> he clenched his fists and faced the terror </s>
<s> thunder crashed </s>
<s> barrels tumbled down the mountainsides and bounced and bounced till their own fury split them open </s>
<s> lightning might strike the steeples of the other churches </s>
<s> not of drew church </s>
<s> a flash illumined the trees as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions </s>
<s> violet whinnied from the stable </s>
<s> he ran out into the downpour sped across the yard and into the buggy room </s>
<s> he shouted and was aghast at the echoes </s>
<s> he would save her </s>
<s> if there was a fire or a flood he would save mama first and violet next </s>
<s> drenched and shaking he stood near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle </s>
<s> after the storm the sky cleared blue and cool and fragrant air swept the hills </s>
<s> when the sun came out stevie strode proudly into orange square smiling like a landlord on industrious tenants </s>
<s> the fountain had brimmed over the cannon were wet the soldiers monument glistened </s>
<s> even before the benches had dried the civil war veterans were straggling back to their places </s>
<s> the great spire shone as if the lightning had polished it </s>
<s> he jumped </s>
<s> the pointed shadow had nearly touched him </s>
<s> he trailed ludie to the baseball game in the lot on kingston street near the dutch reformed </s>
<s> ludie screeched at him </s>
<s> no one told on ludie not even when he slipped live grasshoppers into the mite-box </s>
<s> ludie did as he pleased </s>
<s> ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop to shoot at crows </s>
<s> ludie had a cigar box full of marbles and shooters and a roman candle from last fourth of july </s>
<s> ludie hopped rides on freight cars and was chased by mr yankton the railroad guard </s>
<s> he came home overheated ran straight to the ice-chest and gulped shivery cold water </s>
<s> stevie envied him </s>
<s> that ludie </s>
<s> he too cocked his cap at a jaunty angle jingled marbles in his pocket and swaggered down main street </s>
<s> on the christophers lawn little girls in white pinafores were playing grownups at a tea party </s>
<s> a newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his size </s>
<s> stevie yearned for a dog </s>
<s> he wondered whether god had a dog in the sky </s>
<s> he meandered down pike street past the first national bank with its green window shades </s>
<s> he crossed the tracks to delaware house where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah </s>
<s> a tall lady with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom turned insolent green eyes upon him </s>
<s> she was taller than aggie </s>
<s> she was so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked </s>
<s> fiddles screeched </s>
<s> a piano tinkled </s>
<s> they stayed at hotels and boardinghouses or at private homes </s>
<s> rich people went to delaware house opera house american house or fowler house </s>
<s> if the crummy bastard could write </s>
<s> krist i wish they could write </s>
<s> nigger pussy </s>
<s> he thought of sweet wet nigger pussy </s>
<s> oh sweet land of heaven haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy </s>
<s> he thought of her the first one </s>
<s> he had caught her coming out of the shack </s>
<s> she was a juicy one </s>
<s> oh how they bounced </s>
<s> fresh warm sweet and juicy sweet lovin sixteen she was </s>
<s> man how i love nigger pussy </s>
<s> the snow came a little faster now he noted </s>
<s> he thought of joe harris the nigger who had gone after his sister </s>
<s> he chuckled the memory vivid </s>
<s> jee-sus we fixed him </s>
<s> yooee we fixed him </s>
<s> the snow again </s>
<s> goddamn niggers lord </s>
<s> what i have to put up with </s>
<s> his thoughts turned to other things </s>
<s> the big shock everybody had when they found ol slater and those others done for </s>
<s> kaboom for </s>
<s> he had been pretty scared himself wondering what the hell was coming off </s>
<s> but he soon saw which way the ball was bouncing </s>
<s> soon came back to his senses </s>
<s> i was the first to get my squad on the ball and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb </s>
<s> look at thum </s>
<s> that goddamn redheader was the worst </s>
<s> but i told him goddammit </s>
<s> normal by god </s>
<s> clean the place up </s>
<s> i hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow </s>
<s> keerist </s>
<s> prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him </s>
<s> his eyes blinked hard snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him </s>
<s> a tune began to whirl inside his head </s>
<s> it always came on faithfully just like a radio or juke box whenever he started to worry too much about something when the bad things tried to push their way into him </s>
<s> the music drove them off or away and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments humming and jiving within beating the rhythm within </s>
<s> he glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them </s>
<s> he had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a pow began </s>
<s> it was a word he was proud of a word that meant much to him and he used it with great pleasure almost as if it were an exclusive possession and more he sensed himself to be very highly educated four cuts above any of the folks back home </s>
<s> the word also made him feel hate sincere hate for those so labeled </s>
<s> he used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball </s>
<s> it came up again and again in the discussion sessions </s>
<s> lousy reactionary bastards been tryin to fuck up the program for months </s>
<s> months </s>
<s> hired hard lackeys of the warmongering capitalists </s>
<s> not captured sent here </s>
<s> to fuck up the program </s>
<s> you guys remember that </s>
<s> remember that he heard himself haranguing them </s>
<s> he saw himself before them delivering the speech </s>
<s> he laughed suddenly feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them seeing himself before them receiving utmost respect and attention </s>
<s> he would </s>
<s> that was really something coming from ching </s>
<s> dirty reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off ol slater and those other poor bastards </s>
<s> he felt intense satisfaction </s>
<s> he was tingling within </s>
<s> before him mutilated bleeding to death they lay </s>
<s> it was as if it had been done </s>
<s> he halted and looked around </s>
<s> rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him </s>
<s> the thought came back the one nagging at him these past four days </s>
<s> he tried to stifle it </s>
<s> but the words were forming </s>
<s> he braced himself </s>
<s> he fought it seeking to kill the last few words but on they came out </s>
<s> he was trembling a strange feeling upon him fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot </s>
<s> and he took heart </s>
<s> the final word came forth </s>
<s> now he heard it fully </s>
<s> he felt good </s>
<s> his old self </s>
<s> the music arrived taking him its rhythm </s>
<s> stroked him snaked all through him the lyrics lifted him took him from one magic isle to another stopping briefly at each brandon </s>
<s> he is good </s>
<s> damn good </s>

<s> how he loathed him </s>
<s> sleepy-eyed soft-spoken johnson biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad </s>
<s> he was the guy what always goofed at question time </s>

<s> thoroughly wised up </s>

<s> he turned to the window again </s>
<s> a gnawing and gnashing within him </s>
<s> the snow was tumbling down furiously now </s>

<s> goddamn it </s>
<s> keep the chatter to a minimum short answers one word if possible </s>

<s> anything </s>
<s> give um the works </s>
<s> coughlin grinned feeling supremely on top of things </s>
<s> he watched the snow once again </s>
<s> it infuriated him </s>
<s> it made no sense to him </s>
<s> he whirled around suddenly hot all over finding the man who had been standing before him a few moments back nailing him to the spot on which he now stood open-mouthed </s>
<s> the man shrank before the hot fury searching frantically for the answer </s>
<s> finnegan woke up </s>
<s> there was a hell of a noise this time of morning </s>
<s> he stared out the window </s>
<s> he looked for the source of the noise that had awakened him </s>
<s> it was that prick coughlin </s>
<s> a voice pleaded </s>
<s> just answer </s>

<s> all pricks like coughlin run it anyway one way or another </s>
<s> fuck them </s>
<s> he rolled over and tried to shut out the noise now much louder </s>
<s> he snuggled into the blanket </s>
<s> brandon dreamed </s>
<s> he was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water </s>
<s> a river wide as the missouri where it ran by his place </s>
<s> the log was spinning </s>
<s> but he was not </s>
<s> over on the bank the west bank a man stood calling to him </s>
<s> no doubt it had to do with the log </s>
<s> rousseau is so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books too </s>
<s> but while the two men are riding into the country where they are going to dinner they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of thieves who strip them of everything including most of their clothes </s>
<s> the bandit laughs in his face </s>
<s> but voltaire perseveres </s>
<s> he goes to the chief himself </s>
<s> he asks </s>
<s> he refuses to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher institution </s>
<s> the chief annoyed by these questions knocks voltaire down and shouts at him that he not only never went to any school but never even learned how to read </s>
<s> for it is such a distinguished place with such fine works of art and such a big library that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become depraved by all this culture </s>
<s> immediately after dinner however rousseau asks for still another favor </s>
<s> he is in a hurry to write another essay against culture </s>
<s> such was the impromptu that voltaire gave to howls of laughter at sans souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of europe to be printed sometime later but with the name of timon of athens the famous misanthrope substituted for that of rousseau </s>
<s> how cruel </s>
<s> but at the same time how understandable </s>
<s> this time as a musician </s>
<s> as a composer </s>
<s> ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to fame as the result of a successful opera </s>
<s> but his facility in this genre was not great </s>
<s> and his efforts to get a performance for his gallant muses invariably failed </s>
<s> and for good reasons </s>
<s> his operatic music had little merit </s>
<s> he was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs </s>
<s> cried the ladies enchanted by his music </s>
<s> oh the irony and the bitterness of it </s>
<s> that after all his years of effort to become a composer he should now now when he was still stoutly replying to the critics of his discourse on the arts and sciences be so close to a success in music and have to reject it </s>
<s> or at least appear to reject it </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> that would be too much </s>
<s> these little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender memories of his childhood little melodies that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep </s>
<s> but no </s>
<s> that glory craved for so long was now forbidden to him </s>
<s> still just for the ladies and just for this once for this one weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of his melodies </s>
<s> the ladies were delighted and jean jacques was applauded </s>
<s> and everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote </s>
<s> but then after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited </s>
<s> rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance </s>
<s> every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes and saying yes when she meant no </s>
<s> duclos the historian pointed out to jean jacques that this was impossible </s>
<s> the musicians of the royal opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound </s>
<s> rousseau agreed </s>
<s> but he recalled that rameau had once had a private performance of his opera armide behind closed doors just for himself alone </s>
<s> duclos understood what was bothering rousseau that the writer of the prosopopoeia of fabricius should now become known as the writer of an amusing little operetta </s>
<s> that would certainly be paradoxical </s>
<s> but duclos thought he saw a way out </s>
<s> to that rousseau could agree </s>
<s> but now what crazy twists and turns of his emotions </s>
<s> and how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause </s>
<s> and thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity rousseau suffered through several painful weeks </s>
<s> imagine the honor of it </s>
<s> jean jacques asked striving to appear unimpressed </s>
<s> monsieur de cury was incensed of course </s>
<s> how infuriating all this was </s>
<s> and of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends </s>
<s> but they naturally kept his secret well and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles </s>
<s> how titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals </s>
<s> the furor was such that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational </s>
<s> and listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration trembling lest his authorship become known and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer </s>
<s> he felt himself now as he himself says in his confessions at a crucial point of his life </s>
<s> and that was why on the day of the performance when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace he did not bother to shave </s>
<s> on the contrary he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days </s>
<s> seeing him in that condition and about to enter the hall where the king the queen the whole royal family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present grimm and the abbe raynal and others tried to stop him </s>
<s> they cried </s>
<s> jean jacques asked </s>
<s> they pointed out to him </s>
<s> rousseau asked </s>
<s> surely it would grow there whether i washed myself or not </s>
<s> a hundred years ago i would have worn a beard with pride </s>
<s> and those without beards would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion </s>
<s> and fashion is the real king here </s>
<s> he trembled lest his piece should fail </s>
<s> and this in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society his fear of making some inane or inappropriate remark </s>
<s> and even deeper than that his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself </s>
<s> it was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began </s>
<s> the rider from concord was as good as his word </s>
<s> he came spurring and whooping down the road his horse kicking up clouds of dust shouting </s>
<s> we heard him before he ever showed and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight </s>
<s> i think you could have heard him a mile away and he was bursting at every seam with importance </s>
<s> but i do know that he gave the day tone and distinction </s>
<s> the last thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone wall and this dashing rider made us feel a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation </s>
<s> we came down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us and we crouched behind it </s>
<s> i have heard people talk with contempt about the british regulars but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant </s>
<s> whatever we felt about the redcoats we respected them in terms of their trade which was killing </s>
<s> and i know that i myself was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun </s>
<s> the gun would fire or not just as chance willed </s>
<s> i put a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun because the most important thing i had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it </s>
<s> the gunfire which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now stopped for long enough to count to twenty </s>
<s> and in that brief interval a redcoat officer came tearing down the road whipping his horse fit to kill </s>
<s> but when he passed us by a musket roared and he reared his horse swung it around and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come </s>
<s> he was a fine and showy rider but his skill was wasted on us </s>
<s> from above me and somewhere behind me a rifle cracked </s>
<s> the redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle except that one booted foot caught in the stirrup </s>
<s> it was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays </s>
<s> for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight </s>
<s> but this grinning broken head not ten feet away from me was the sharp definition of what my reality had become </s>
<s> and now the redcoats were coming and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us </s>
<s> i must state that the faster things happened the slower they happened </s>
<s> the passage and rhythm of time changed and when i remember back to what happened then each event is a separate and frozen incident </s>
<s> in my recollection there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely </s>
<s> yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds and then the front of the british army came into view </s>
<s> it was only hours since i had last seen them but they had changed and i had changed </s>
<s> in the very front rank two men were wounded and staggered along trailing blood behind them </s>
<s> no drummers here no pipers and the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust </s>
<s> they marched with bayonets fixed and as fixed on their faces was anger fear and torment </s>
<s> rank after rank of them came down the road and the faces were all the same and they walked in a sea of dust </s>
<s> a voice called and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant only some of them glancing toward the stone wall from behind which the voice came </s>
<s> the front of their column had already passed us when another officer came riding down the side of the road not five paces from where we were </s>
<s> my cousin simmons carried a musket but he had loaded it with bird shot and as the officer came opposite him he rose up behind the wall and fired </s>
<s> one moment there was a man in the saddle </s>
<s> the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks and during the next second or two we all of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers </s>
<s> one moment the road was filled with disciplined troops marching four by four with a purpose as implacable as death </s>
<s> the next a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming fury of sound out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury </s>
<s> in the course of this they had fired on us </s>
<s> but i have no memory of that </s>
<s> i had squeezed the trigger of my own gun and to my amazement it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule </s>
<s> and then i was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound hurling more vile language than i ever thought i knew sobbing and shouting and aware that if i had passed water before it was not enough for my pants were soaking wet </s>
<s> i would have stood there and died there if left to myself but cousin simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there </s>
<s> and then i came to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that i outdistanced cousin simmons by far </s>
<s> everyone else was running </s>
<s> later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall </s>
<s> their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching </s>
<s> a dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane as perhaps we were at that moment with the crazy excitement of our first encounter the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road and the thirst of some of the men which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it </s>
<s> isaac pitt one of the men from lincoln had taken a musket ball in his belly </s>
<s> and though he had found the strength to run with us now he collapsed and lay on the ground dying the reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow </s>
<s> i know that i myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a british musket ball as isaac had been yet i also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself </s>
<s> i was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road and the fact that i was not afraid now but only waiting to know what to do next </s>
<s> meanwhile i reloaded my gun as the other men were doing </s>
<s> we were less than a quarter of a mile from the road and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it </s>
<s> wherever you looked you saw committeemen running across the meadows some away from the road some toward it some parallel to it </s>
<s> and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty militia were making their way in our direction </s>
<s> cousin joshua and some others felt that we should march toward lexington and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving british column but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road </s>
<s> someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it the british would be gone </s>
<s> but cousin simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts </s>
<s> while this was being discussed we saw the militia to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road </s>
<s> it was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the committeemen who had been in the battle of the north bridge which entitled them to a sort of veteran status and we felt that if they employed this tactic it was likely enough the best one </s>
<s> mattathias dover said </s>
<s> that settled it and we broke into parties of two and three </s>
<s> we ran east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road panting from the effort and soaked with sweat </s>
<s> there was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road and the shouting and gunfire never slackened </s>
<s> under the trees there was a dead redcoat a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimples who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes </s>
<s> three men were around him </s>
<s> they had stripped him of his musket and equipment and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off </s>
<s> cousin simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away </s>
<s> cousin simmons roared </s>
<s> they tried to outface him but joseph simmons was as wide as two average men and it would have taken braver men than these were to outface him </s>
<s> that summer the gambling houses were closed despite the threats of pierre ameaux a gaming-card manufacturer </s>
<s> dancing was no longer permitted in the streets </s>
<s> the bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied </s>
<s> the slit breeches had to go </s>
<s> drunkenness was no longer tolerated </s>
<s> plunking themselves down on the front bench they turned to smirk at those around them </s>
<s> but the thought occurred that god would want this opportunity used to tell them about him </s>
<s> calmly he opened the bible and read of the woman at the well </s>
<s> he finished the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor god and man </s>
<s> the next morning as the clock struck nine he appeared at the council meeting in the town hall and insisted that the couple would have to be punished if the church was to be respected </s>
<s> john stiffened in anger </s>
<s> monsieur favre sat down in his high-backed stall lips compressed eyes glinting </s>
<s> ablard corne a short man with a rotunda of stomach rose </s>
<s> every eye was on him as he began to speak </s>
<s> abel poupin a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes got to his feet </s>
<s> philibert berthelier the son of the famous patriot disagreed </s>
<s> john was quietly insistent </s>
<s> a week later the sentence of the council was carried out jake camaret and the woman were marched naked through the streets past a mocking populace </s>
<s> charles had died two weeks before in early november without being reconciled to the church </s>
<s> the canons in a body had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last rites of the church but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith </s>
<s> burial had taken place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug up and burned </s>
<s> the abbot of st eloi claude de mommor had been a good friend but not even he thought charles deserved burial in hallowed ground </s>
<s> the blue-draped virgin was still there but no one knelt before her now </s>
<s> not even varnessa </s>
<s> she too prayed only to god </s>
<s> but he had to follow the light </s>
<s> the white-clad trees stood like specters in the february night </s>
<s> a carriage crunched by its dim lights filtering through the gloom </s>
<s> the sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated the holes of his shoes his only ones now patched with folded parchment </s>
<s> the city had recently given him a small salary but it was not enough to supply even necessities </s>
<s> as he neared the square a round figure muffled in a long black cape whisked by </s>
<s> john recognized ablard corne and called out a greeting </s>
<s> how grateful he was to such men </s>
<s> there were several on the council who tried to live like christians </s>
<s> despite their efforts the problems seemed to grow graver all the time </s>
<s> quickening his steps john entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells </s>
<s> underneath the big one in the silent moonlight lay a dead pigeon and on the smaller bell the clemence two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air </s>
<s> john leaned upon the stone balustrade </s>
<s> below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks </s>
<s> above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars </s>
<s> he stood very still his arms at his sides staring up at the heavens then down at the blinking lights below </s>
<s> sleep was difficult these days </s>
<s> indigestion plagued him </s>
<s> severe headaches were frequent </s>
<s> loneliness tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of peter robert nerien nicholas cop martin bucer and even the compromising louis du tillet </s>
<s> an occasional traveler from italy brought news of peter robert who was now distributing his bible among the waldensian peasants </s>
<s> letters came regularly from nerien nicholas and martin </s>
<s> he had anthony and william to confide in and consult </s>
<s> but william continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and tearing down symbols sacred to the old church </s>
<s> john found it difficult but he held him in check </s>
<s> and anthony was busy most of the time courting this girl and that </s>
<s> his easy good looks made him a favorite with the ladies </s>
<s> geneva instead of becoming the city of god as john had dreamed had in the two years since he had been there continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished </s>
<s> refugees poured in signing the confession and rules in order to remain and then disregarding them </s>
<s> dice rolled prostitutes plied their trade thieves stole murderers stabbed and the ungodly blasphemed </s>
<s> catholics who were truly christians longed for the simple penance of days gone by </s>
<s> tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight </s>
<s> unless the confusion cleared he would not be coming here much longer </s>
<s> the slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his reverie </s>
<s> faint at first the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the wind </s>
<s> eli corault </s>
<s> john thought </s>
<s> he started down the steps to meet the near-blind preacher who had been one of the early gospelers in paris </s>
<s> john stood above him his face ashen </s>
<s> john asked tiredly </s>
<s> i went to your rooms and anthony told me you were here </s>
<s> two anabaptists caroli and benoit are to challenge you and william to a debate before the council </s>
<s> it is to be a trap </s>
<s> anger and fear fused in john </s>
<s> ever since the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of christ </s>
<s> those who refused to believe that he was the eternal son of god were termed arianists </s>
<s> peter caroli had come to geneva saying that he had been a bishop of the church of rome and had been persecuted in paris for his reformed faith </s>
<s> he asked to be appointed a preacher </s>
<s> but michael sept had unmasked him revealing he had never been a bishop but was an anabaptist afraid to state his faith because he knew john calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death </s>
<s> so john had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher and now caroli sought revenge </s>
<s> john sighed </s>
<s> matters such as leavened or unleavened bread are inconsequential </s>
<s> geneva must remain a sovereign state </s>
<s> the following morning as john entered the place molard on his way to visit a sick refugee he had a premonition of danger </s>
<s> then suddenly a group of men and dogs circled him </s>
<s> he wanted to run but he knew that if he did he would be lost </s>
<s> he stood very still his heart thumping wildly </s>
<s> on the outskirts of the rabble the camaret brothers and gaspard favre shook their fists </s>
<s> the chinless jake called </s>
<s> a rowdy with a big blob of a nose roared </s>
<s> john lifted his hand for silence </s>
<s> his voice shook a little </s>
<s> somebody heaved a stone </s>
<s> for an instant john was stunned </s>
<s> when he felt the side of his head his fingers came away covered with blood </s>
<s> before he could duck another stone struck him </s>
<s> and another </s>
<s> pierre ameaux the gaming-card manufacturer said his little pig eyes glaring </s>
<s> the crowd moved back and john started dizzily down the hill </s>
<s> fists pummeled him as he staggered forward </s>
<s> then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow </s>
<s> at once a bevy of dogs was snapping and snarling around him </s>
<s> one more horrible than the rest lunged growling deep in his throat his hair bristling </s>
<s> with great difficulty john clambered to his feet and started to run sweat pouring down his face </s>
<s> there was of course no real need to rearrange everything </s>
<s> adam watched his own hands make the caressing anxious movement that when rain falls and nobody comes and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the ankles has been the ritual of stall vendors forever </s>
<s> he recognized the gesture </s>
<s> he knew its meaning </s>
<s> he had seen a dry old yellowing hand reach out with that painful solicitude to touch to rearrange to shift aimlessly some object worth a pfennig </s>
<s> back in bavaria he had seen that gesture and at that sight his heart had always died within him </s>
<s> on such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand whatever face it might be </s>
<s> now the face was his own </s>
<s> he wondered what expression as he made that gesture was on his face </s>
<s> he wondered if it wore the old anxiety or the old taut stoicism </s>
<s> but there was no need he remembered for his hand to reach out for his face to show concern or stoicism </s>
<s> it was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came </s>
<s> this was virginia </s>
<s> he looked out of the tent at the company street </s>
<s> the rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street </s>
<s> beyond that misty gray of the rain he saw the stretching hutment low diminutive log cabins chinked with mud with doorways a man would have to crouch to get through with roofs of tenting laid over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes or fence rails with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud </s>
<s> the chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out </s>
<s> in this heavy air however that device did not seem to help </s>
<s> the smoke from that chimney rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other and hung as sadly in the drizzle creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof </s>
<s> over the door was a board with large inept lettering home sweet home </s>
<s> this was the hut of simms purdew the hero </s>
<s> the men were huddled in those lairs </s>
<s> adam knew the names of some </s>
<s> he knew the faces of all hairy or shaven old or young fat or thin suffering or hardened sad or gay good or bad </s>
<s> when they stood about his tent chaffing each other exchanging their obscenities cursing command or weather he had studied their faces </s>
<s> he had had the need to understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh behind the oath the banter the sadness </s>
<s> once covertly looking at simms purdew the only man in the world whom he hated he had seen the heavy slack bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel obscene banter and had seen the pale-blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that vile creature </s>
<s> he was seeing somehow the face of a young boy the boy simms purdew must once have been a boy with sorrel hair and blue eyes dancing with gaiety and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles </s>
<s> in that moment of vision adam heard the voice within himself saying i must not hate him i must not hate him or i shall die </s>
<s> his heart suddenly opened to joy </s>
<s> he thought that if once only once he could talk with simms purdew something about his own life and all life would be clear and simple </s>
<s> if only simms purdew could do that whatever the thing he remembered and told </s>
<s> it would be a sign for the untellable and he adam would understand </s>
<s> now adam in the gray light of afternoon stared across at the hut opposite his tent and thought of simms purdew lying in there in the gloom snoring on his bunk with the fumes of whisky choking the air </s>
<s> he saw the sign above the door of the hut home sweet home </s>
<s> he saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street with an armful of wood </s>
<s> it was pullen james the campmate of simms purdew </s>
<s> he carried the wood carried the water did the cooking cleaning and mending and occasionally got a kick in the butt for his pains </s>
<s> adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho </s>
<s> it gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam like metal </s>
<s> pullen james humbly lowered his head pushed aside the hardtack-box door of the hut and was gone from sight </s>
<s> adam stared at the door and remembered that simms purdew had been awarded the medal of honor for gallantry at antietam </s>
<s> the street was again empty </s>
<s> the drizzle was slacking off now but the light was grayer </s>
<s> with enormous interest adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him </s>
<s> into the emptiness of the street and his spirit moved a form </s>
<s> the form was swathed in an army blanket much patched fastened at the neck with a cord </s>
<s> from under the shapeless huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud </s>
<s> the feet wore army shoes in obvious disrepair </s>
<s> the head was wrapped in a turban and on top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho had been flung </s>
<s> the gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle </s>
<s> moisture ran down the cheeks gathered at the tip of the nose and at the chin </s>
<s> the figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching to dislodge the drop clinging there </s>
<s> the figure stopped and one hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose </s>
<s> then the figure moved on </s>
<s> this was one of the irish women who had built their own huts down near the river </s>
<s> they did washing </s>
<s> adam recognized this one </s>
<s> he recognized her because she was the one who in a winter twilight on the edge of camp had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly </s>
<s> she had queried in her soft guttural </s>
<s> her name was mollie </s>
<s> they called her mollie the mutton and laughed </s>
<s> looking down the street after her adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket </s>
<s> he could not make out but he knew that again she was scratching her nose </s>
<s> mollie the mutton was scratching her nose </s>
<s> the words ran crazily in his head mollie the mutton is scratching her nose in the rain </s>
<s> the pattern would not stop </s>
<s> it came again and again </s>
<s> he felt trapped in that pattern in the repetition </s>
<s> suddenly he thought he might weep </s>
<s> he demanded out loud </s>
<s> he looked wildly around at the now empty street at the mud at the rain </s>
<s> he demanded </s>
<s> when he had stored his stock in the great oak chest locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain tied the fly of the tent and picked up the cash box he moved up the darkening street </s>
<s> he would consign the cash box into the hands of jed hawksworth then stand by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items sold </s>
<s> he did not know </s>
<s> his mind closed on that prospect as though fog had descended to blot out a valley </s>
<s> far off in the dusk he heard voices singing muffled but strong </s>
<s> in one of the huts a group of men were huddled together singing </s>
<s> he stopped </s>

<s> he was standing there he thought in virginia in the thickening dusk in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to another jew </s>

<s> adam thought of the hutments regiment after regiment row after row the thousands of huts stretching away into the night </s>
<s> he thought of the men the nameless thousands huddling in them </s>
<s> he thought of simms purdew snoring on his bunk while pullen james crouched by the hearth skirmishing an undershirt for lice and a wet log sizzled </s>
<s> he thought of simms purdew who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield a maniacal scream on his lips and swung a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of rebel bayonets about him </s>
<s> he thought of simms purdew rising up fearless in glory </s>
<s> he felt the sweetness of pity flood through him veining his very flesh </s>
<s> those men lying in the huts they did not know </s>

<s> soon she was parading around the house flaunting her new skill </s>
<s> the comfort was short-lived yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion </s>

<s> tuesday </s>
<s> the heat intensified on tuesday </s>
<s> he and irvin moll were sipping coffee at the breakfast bar </s>
<s> the night before they had telephoned the andrus maid selena masters and she had arrived early bursting her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused mcfeeley and confounded moll </s>
<s> selena was the wrong woman for these crudities </s>
<s> sergeant moll understood </s>
<s> the maid was very black and very energetic trim in a yellow pique uniform </s>
<s> her speech was barren of southernisms </s>
<s> not seeing her dark intelligent face one would have gauged the voice as that of a westwood village matron ten years out of iowa </s>
<s> while she was thus engaged mcfeeley questioned her about her whereabouts the previous day any recollections she had of people hanging around of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen of strange cars cruising the neighborhood </s>
<s> she answered him precisely missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports </s>
<s> selena masters joe realized was her own woman </s>
<s> when the parents emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later the maid greeted them quietly </s>
<s> she charged off to the bedrooms </s>
<s> moll took his coffee into the nursery </s>
<s> during the night a phone company technician had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones </s>
<s> someone would have to remain in the office continually </s>
<s> mcfeeley greeted the parents then studied his notebook </s>
<s> he wanted to take the mother to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> andrus did not answer him </s>
<s> his face was bloated with drugging redder than normal </s>
<s> the woman had the glassy look of an invalid as if she had not slept at all </s>
<s> we can expect more of the same </s>
<s> he settled on the sofa with his coffee warming his hands on the cup although the room was heavy with heat </s>
<s> the three had little to say to each other </s>
<s> kidnaper spurns ransom </s>
<s> amy still missing </s>
<s> mcfeeley told the parents he would escort them to police headquarters in a half hour </s>
<s> before that he wanted to talk to the neighbors </s>
<s> he could think of nothing else to tell them no assurances no hopeful hints at great discoveries that day </s>
<s> when the detective left andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project </s>
<s> mrs andrus was talking to the maid arranging for her to come in every day instead of the four days she now worked </s>
<s> outside only a handful of reporters remained </s>
<s> in contrast to the caravan of the previous night there were only four cars parked across the street </s>
<s> two men he did not recognize were sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls </s>
<s> he did not see sparling or degroot or ringel or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed him twelve hours ago </s>
<s> however the litter remained augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers </s>
<s> the street cleaner had not yet been around </s>
<s> and he ignored him skirting the parked cars and walking up the path to the skopas house </s>
<s> mcfeeley identified himself </s>
<s> the master of the house his nourished face unrevealing consented to postpone his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective </s>
<s> flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait </s>
<s> it was amazing how they had herded together for protection an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper rising from the breakfast table </s>
<s> a gross boy in his teens shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands </s>
<s> a girl in her twenties fat and sullen descending the marble staircase </s>
<s> then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor </s>
<s> they answered him in monosyllables nods occasionally muttering in greek to one another awaiting the word from papa who restlessly cracked his knuckles anxious to stuff himself into his white cadillac and burst off to the freeway </s>
<s> yes they had read about the case </s>
<s> yes they had let some reporters use their phone but they would no longer </s>
<s> they offered no opinions volunteered nothing betrayed no emotions </s>
<s> studying them mcfeeley could not help make comparison with the andrus couple </s>
<s> the skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy </s>
<s> the equation was simple wealth brought them happiness and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had let no one in on the secrets </s>
<s> by comparison fritzie and laura andrus were quivering fledglings </s>
<s> they possessed no outer fortifications no hard shells of confidence </s>
<s> they had enough difficulty getting from day to day let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them </s>
<s> skopas expressed no curiosity over the case offered no expression of sympathy made no move to escort mcfeely to the door </s>
<s> all four remained impacted on the sofa until he had left </s>
<s> he had spoken to mrs </s>
<s> emerson the previous day </s>
<s> there remained a family named kahler owners of a two-story tudor-style house on the south side of the andrus home </s>
<s> their names had not come up in any discussions with laura and he had no idea what they would be like </s>
<s> mcfeeley noted the immaculate lawn and gardens each blade of grass cropped bright and firm </s>
<s> each shrub glazed with good health </s>
<s> when joe identified himself he nodded unsmiling and ushered him into a sedate living room </s>
<s> mrs kahler joined them </s>
<s> both were dressed rather formally </s>
<s> the man wore a vest and a tie the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands of pearls </s>
<s> mcfeeley looked puzzled </s>
<s> the dog refused to be scared off so kahler had purchased some small firecrackers </s>
<s> both grinned at the detective </s>
<s> in the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room and then they went across the hall to the kitchen </s>
<s> she was intimidated by the stove </s>
<s> he found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners for her </s>
<s> the gas flamed up two inches high </s>
<s> they found the teakettle </s>
<s> and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox </s>
<s> several sections of a loaf of dark bread </s>
<s> butter </s>
<s> jam </s>
<s> a tiny cake of ice </s>
<s> in their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver they opened every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry </s>
<s> while she was settling the teacart he went back across the hall to their bedroom opened one of the suitcases and took out powdered coffee and sugar </s>
<s> she appeared with the teacart and he opened the windows </s>
<s> a sleepy voice answered </s>
<s> at the same time his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable peace-loving and dependable in everybody </s>
<s> since ordinary breakfast-table conversation was impossible it was at least something that they were able to offer eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it and the plate of bread and butter and that eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first </s>
<s> eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water </s>
<s> they assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained </s>
<s> harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee in his cup and filled it with hot water and then stirring he sat back in his chair </s>
<s> the chair creaked </s>
<s> every time he moved or said something the chair creaked again </s>
<s> it went right on creaking under his own considerable weight and all it needed harold thought was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it </s>
<s> harold indicated the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in </s>
<s> eugene told him and he promptly forgot </s>
<s> they passed the marmalade the bread the black-market butter back and forth </s>
<s> nothing was said about hotels or train journeys </s>
<s> eugene offered harold his car to use at any time he cared to and when this offer was not accepted the armchair creaked </s>
<s> they all three had another cup of coffee </s>
<s> eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown and on his large feet he wore yellow turkish slippers that turned up at the toes </s>
<s> the first shrill ring of the telephone brought harold out into the hall </s>
<s> he realized that he had no idea where the telephone was </s>
<s> at that moment the bathroom door flew open and eugene came out with his face lathered for shaving and strode down the hall tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went </s>
<s> the telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall </s>
<s> between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord and when the conversation came to an end eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment to his bathroom where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub </s>
<s> before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them </s>
<s> harold shook his head </s>
<s> he handed harold a key to the front door and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment </s>
<s> when enough time had elapsed so that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another </s>
<s> in the room next to theirs was a huge cradle of mahogany ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf </s>
<s> it was the most important-looking cradle he had ever seen </s>
<s> then came their bathroom and then a bedroom that judging by the photographs on the walls must belong to mme cestre </s>
<s> a young woman who looked like alix with her two children </s>
<s> alix and eugene on their wedding day </s>
<s> mme vienot considerably younger and very different </s>
<s> the schoolboy </s>
<s> it was the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person </s>
<s> with the metal shutters closed the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there </s>
<s> one of the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet </s>
<s> though taken individually the big rooms were or seemed to be square the apartment as a whole formed a triangle </s>
<s> the apex the study where eugene slept was light and bright and airy and cheerful </s>
<s> looking around slowly he saw a marble fireplace a desk a low bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass panes in the doors </s>
<s> the daybed eugene had slept in made up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillows </s>
<s> the portable record player with a pile of classical records beside it </s>
<s> besides the records were dusty </s>
<s> he tried the doors of the bookcase </s>
<s> locked </s>
<s> the titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed wires works on theology astral physics history biology political science </s>
<s> no poetry </s>
<s> no novels </s>
<s> he moved over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything </s>
<s> the clock on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room </s>
<s> the concierge called out to them as they were passing through the foyer </s>
<s> the suitcases had come while they were out and had been put in their room the concierge said </s>
<s> rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered they had gone sight-seeing </s>
<s> they went to the flea market expecting to find the treasures of europe and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in tours </s>
<s> cheap clothing and junk of every sort as far as the eye could see </s>
<s> they looked even so </s>
<s> looked at everything </s>
<s> barbara bought some cotton aprons and harold bought shoestrings </s>
<s> they had lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad busy unpicturesque streets and coming home they got lost in the metro </s>
<s> it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed in order to take the line that went to the place redoute </s>
<s> it was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole </s>
<s> when he opened the door there stood eugene on his way out of the apartment </s>
<s> he was wearing sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt and in his hand he carried a little black bag </s>
<s> he did not explain where he was going and they did not ask </s>
<s> instead they went on down the hall to their room </s>
<s> barbara asked as they heard the front door close </s>
<s> they had vermouth sitting in front of a cafe </s>
<s> when they got home harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment and thought how under different circumstances they might have stayed on here in these old-fashioned high-ceilinged rooms that reminded him of the irelands apartment in the east eighties </s>
<s> they could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days </s>
<s> he felt them </s>
<s> they were damp </s>
<s> he reached out and felt the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub </s>
<s> damp also </s>
<s> barbara asked standing in the doorway </s>
<s> there it is and there is what was in it </s>
<s> she looked at him in surprise </s>
<s> so something like this matters more than it would at home </s>
<s> i wish i did </s>
<s> the tweed coat maybe </s>
<s> and the thing about hurt feelings the wet bathing suit pointed out is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be </s>
<s> fortunately the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields </s>
<s> and in any case answers may clarify but they do not change anything </s>
<s> he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred pounds weight </s>
<s> that is how the jews prepare a body for burial </s>
<s> search as he might he could find no place where the bible spoke of a moment when mary could have been alone with jesus </s>
<s> in his concept there could be no one else present </s>
<s> his first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe </s>
<s> those who saw his finished pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses </s>
<s> they would feel what mary was undergoing </s>
<s> there would be no halos no angels </s>
<s> these would be two human beings whom god had chosen </s>
<s> he felt close to mary having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey </s>
<s> now she was intensely alive anguished </s>
<s> her son was dead </s>
<s> even though he would later be resurrected he was at this moment dead indeed the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross </s>
<s> in his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what jesus felt for his mother </s>
<s> only what mary felt for her son </s>
<s> jesus inert body would be passive his eyes closed </s>
<s> mary would have to carry the human communication </s>
<s> this seemed right to him </s>
<s> it was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems </s>
<s> his mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child </s>
<s> there was only one way to accomplish this by design by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept </s>
<s> he started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper </s>
<s> visually these approximated what he was feeling within himself </s>
<s> at the same time he started walking the streets peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like how they moved </s>
<s> in particular he sought the gentle sweet-faced nuns with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper </s>
<s> discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes he began a study of the anatomy of folds </s>
<s> he improvised as he went along completing a life-size clay figure then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that argiento brought from the bank of the tiber to the consistency of thick mud </s>
<s> when the cloth dried and stiffened he saw what adjustments had to be made </s>
<s> michelangelo grinned </s>
<s> he went into the jewish quarter wanting to draw hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how christ might have looked </s>
<s> the jewish section was in trastevere near the tiber at the church of san francesco a ripa </s>
<s> many of their gifted members were prominent in the vatican as physicians musicians bankers </s>
<s> the men did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose </s>
<s> he was told to ask for rabbi melzi at the synagogue on saturday afternoon </s>
<s> michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head </s>
<s> he was reading from the talmud with a group of men from his congregation </s>
<s> when michelangelo explained why he had come rabbi melzi replied gravely </s>
<s> i wish to make jesus an authentic jew </s>
<s> in their mid-thirties </s>
<s> not bulky laborers but sinewy men </s>
<s> with intelligence </s>
<s> rabbi melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes </s>
<s> sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch </s>
<s> michelangelo bought some scrap lumber </s>
<s> together he and argiento built the stand covering it with blankets </s>
<s> his first model arrived at dusk </s>
<s> he hesitated for a moment when michelangelo asked him to disrobe so michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes </s>
<s> the model quite plainly thought michelangelo crazy </s>
<s> only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting </s>
<s> but at the end of the sitting when michelangelo showed him the quick free drawings with the mother roughed in holding her son the model grasped what michelangelo was after and promised to speak to his friends </s>
<s> he worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi </s>
<s> mary presented quite a different problem </s>
<s> though this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties old wrinkled broken in body and face by labor or worry </s>
<s> his image of the virgin had always been that of a young woman even as had his memory of his mother </s>
<s> jacopo galli introduced him into several roman homes </s>
<s> here he sketched sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk young girls not yet twenty some about to be married some married a year or two </s>
<s> since the santo spirito hospital had taken only men he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy </s>
<s> but he had sketched the women of tuscany in their fields and homes </s>
<s> he was able to discern the body lines of the roman women under their robes </s>
<s> he spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together a mary who would be young and sensitive yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap </s>
<s> and a jesus who though lean was strong even in death a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of santo spirito </s>
<s> he drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory without need to consult his sketches </s>
<s> soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay </s>
<s> here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms </s>
<s> when he wanted to emphasize or get greater intensity he added or subtracted clay </s>
<s> next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence </s>
<s> he respected each of these approach techniques and kept them in character his quill drawings had a scratchiness suggesting skin texture </s>
<s> the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh as in an abdomen in a reclining torso </s>
<s> the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull </s>
<s> yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind </s>
<s> they remained rough starting points </s>
<s> when carving he was charged with spontaneous energy </s>
<s> too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model </s>
<s> the true surge had to be inside the marble itself </s>
<s> drawing and models were his thinking </s>
<s> carving was action </s>
<s> the arrangement with argiento was working well except that sometimes michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice </s>
<s> argiento had been trained so rigorously by the jesuits that michelangelo was unable to change his habits up before dawn to scrub the floors whether they were dirty or not </s>
<s> water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day the pots scoured with river sand after each meal </s>
<s> scrub the studio once a week </s>
<s> before dawn </s>
<s> grumbled michelangelo </s>
<s> yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about for argiento made few demands on him </s>
<s> the boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into rome </s>
<s> on sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them and in particular to see their horses </s>
<s> the one thing he missed from his farm in the po valley was the animals </s>
<s> frequently he would take his leave of michelangelo by announcing </s>
<s> it took a piece of bad luck to show michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him </s>
<s> he was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil </s>
<s> he stumbled into the house eyes burning like fire </s>
<s> argiento made him lie down on the bed brought a pan of hot water dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter </s>
<s> though the pain was considerable michelangelo was not too concerned </s>
<s> he assumed he could blink the splinter out </s>
<s> but it would not come </s>
<s> argiento never left his side keeping the water boiled applying hot compresses throughout the night </s>
<s> by the second day michelangelo began to worry </s>
<s> and by the second night he was in a state of panic he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye </s>
<s> at dawn argiento went to jacopo galli </s>
<s> galli arrived with his family surgeon maestro lippi </s>
<s> the surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons </s>
<s> the surgeon came back at dusk cut the vein of a second pigeon again washed out the eye </s>
<s> beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps </s>
<s> the thin legs twitched convulsively once then kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound </s>
<s> the scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands </s>
<s> the child was gone </s>
<s> they put kate to bed and wired jonathan and sent for the young presbyterian minister </s>
<s> when he told her god had called the child to him she rejected his words rebelliously </s>
<s> few of the neighbors came but mrs tussle came called by tragedy </s>
<s> they held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot </s>
<s> kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment </s>
<s> she would not accept the death of such a little child </s>
<s> god would not do that kate thought stubbornly </s>
<s> she had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son </s>
<s> joel came and sat mutely with her sharing her pain and anguish averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom </s>
<s> juanita and mrs tussle kept kate in bed a week until her milk dried </s>
<s> when she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty </s>
<s> she disciplined herself daily to do what must be done </s>
<s> seeing the slanting hand kate knew uneasily that it was from the yankee colonel </s>
<s> the federal forces had taken parkersburg and grafton from the rebels and were moving to take all the mountains </s>
<s> kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended at what involvement existed for juanita </s>
<s> uncle randolph and joel had replanted the bottom lands with difficulty for more of the slaves including annie had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp </s>
<s> joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school </s>
<s> he had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from harpers ferry </s>
<s> kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss </s>
<s> she loved him and missed his company </s>
<s> uncle randolph had been riding out every evening on some secret business of his own </s>
<s> what it was kate could not fathom </s>
<s> joel knew what he was about however </s>
<s> he patted the eye joel had had blackened in a fight over being rebel at the crossroads some days back </s>
<s> kate had no idea what they were talking of although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night had heard horsemen on the river road and hill trails through the nights till dawn </s>
<s> hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house cold sober </s>
<s> what he was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by general mcclellan threatening reprisals against rebel guerrillas </s>
<s> she was taken up in worry for the reckless old man </s>
<s> kate drew more and more on her affection for joel through the hot days of summer work </s>
<s> she had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer after she saw miss snow crack joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom </s>
<s> he had the hardest pains of growing before him now as he approached twelve </s>
<s> these would be his hardest years she knew and he missed his father desperately </s>
<s> she tried to find some way to draw him out to help him </s>
<s> whenever she found time she went blackberry picking with him and they would come home together mouths purple arms and faces scratched tired enough to forget grief for another day </s>
<s> he tended the new colts beau had sired </s>
<s> no one went much to the crossroads now except uncle randolph </s>
<s> they stayed in their own world on the bluff waiting for letters and the peddler bringing the news </s>
<s> jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of harpers ferry before they abandoned it </s>
<s> the men were restive he wrote ready to take the battle to the enemy as jackson wished </s>
<s> the peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in wheeling which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors </s>
<s> dangling his gaudy trinkets before them he told of the rebel losses in the mountains at cheat and rich mountains both and the federal march on beverly </s>
<s> maj anderson of fort sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the us army </s>
<s> rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley </s>
<s> accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old george down to parkersburg for the news </s>
<s> in the next few days they had cause to rejoice </s>
<s> it had been a big battle and the confederate forces had won </s>
<s> jonathan and ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing </s>
<s> kate and mrs tussle waited for letters anxiously </s>
<s> joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate </s>
<s> when kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out she saw other dots of flames among the western virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful </s>
<s> they all prayed now that the north would realize that peace must come for virginia had defended her land victoriously </s>
<s> they had already lost most of their corn she thought </s>
<s> at the landing she saw juanita her face flushed pink with excitement run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door </s>
<s> juanita stopped just inside the open door her hand to her mouth </s>
<s> as kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw colonel marsh framed in the doorway his face set in the same vulnerable look juanita wore </s>
<s> kate greeted him gravely uneasy with misgivings at his visit </s>
<s> she asked taking him and juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun </s>
<s> he has notified me that he has orders to go to washington to take over the army of the potomac </s>
<s> kate asked watching them both now anxiously </s>

<s> it would be better for joel and uncle randolph and mrs tussle not to see them </s>
<s> kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations </s>

<s> now driving the horse and sulky borrowed from mynheer schuyler he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move </s>
<s> the road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather than the hudson river valley of his boyhood memories </s>
<s> he would cross to manhattan to harlem heights before morning </s>
<s> there a certain farmhouse was a station for the sons of liberty </s>
<s> he would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news </s>
<s> and he would sleep sleep and never think of roads and horses sore haunches of colonial wars </s>
<s> strange how everything here fitted back into his life even if he had been away so long </s>
<s> mynheer sir francis the valley society the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road </s>
<s> a mist was walking on the water white as cotton but with a blending and merging grace </s>
<s> ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads </s>
<s> david reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet </s>
<s> he pulled out one of them and cocked it </s>
<s> a strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes </s>
<s> it was a grotesque hen five or six feet tall </s>
<s> it had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers </s>
<s> its groin was bloody </s>
<s> black strips of skin hung from it </s>
<s> the horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils </s>
<s> david took a firm hand with it </s>
<s> the creature in feathers looked around and david saw the mad eyes glazed with an insane fear </s>
<s> the ungainly bird thing ran away and to david its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster </s>
<s> then it was gone </s>
<s> he drove on wary and shaken </s>
<s> the sons were out tonight </s>
<s> new york lay bleaching in the summer sun and the morning fish hawk flying in the heated air saw below him the long triangular wedge of manhattan island </s>
<s> it was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets mostly around the battery going bravely north to wall street but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of harlem heights </s>
<s> on the east side of the island of manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the east river that connected new york bay with long island sound </s>
<s> on the western tip of long island protruded brooklyn heights </s>
<s> it commanded a view over manhattan and the harbor </s>
<s> a fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields </s>
<s> husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences and there were grazing cattle </s>
<s> the morning hawk hungry for any eatable killable digestible item kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay sheltered by the jersey inlets </s>
<s> they often threw tidbits overboard </s>
<s> the larger ships were near paulus hook already being called by a few jersey city </s>
<s> the fish hawk his wings not moving circled and glided lower </s>
<s> the gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black the bronze cannon at the ports </s>
<s> the chevaux de frise those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the battery pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in </s>
<s> across the bay the palisades were heavy in green timber </s>
<s> their rock paths led down to the hudson </s>
<s> below in the open bay facing manhattan was staten island gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind which nested farms cattle barns and berry thickets </s>
<s> today tomorrow six months even perhaps a year </s>
<s> the fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight </s>
<s> the british ships rolled at anchor sent out picket boats and waited for orders from london </s>
<s> david cortlandt having slept away a day and a night came awake in a plank farmhouse on the harlem river near spuyten duyvil </s>
<s> the road seemed animated with a few more wagons than usual </s>
<s> a carriage raising up the choking june dust and beyond in a meadow a local militia company drilling with muskets kentuck rifles every kind of horse pistol old sword or cutlass </s>
<s> pensive introspective he ached </s>
<s> he had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept </s>
<s> now there was more to do </s>
<s> orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government </s>
<s> he scratched his mosquito-plagued neck </s>
<s> from the saddlebags hung on a hitchcock chair david took out a good english razor a present from john hunter </s>
<s> he found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost </s>
<s> he hoped he was free of self-deception </s>
<s> here he was suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war in the spite and calumny of whigs and tories </s>
<s> there would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war </s>
<s> david cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface </s>
<s> he knew that many were using it for their own ends </s>
<s> but it did not matter </s>
<s> he stropped the razor slowly </s>
<s> what mattered was that a new concept of americans was being born </s>
<s> that some men did not want it he could understand </s>
<s> the moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers </s>
<s> yet some like morris manderscheid would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas </s>
<s> unique circumstances would test us all he decided </s>
<s> injury and ingratitude would occur </s>
<s> no doubt john hancock would do well now </s>
<s> war was a smugglers heaven </s>
<s> things like that would increase rather than be done away with </s>
<s> one had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing </s>
<s> he saw with john hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream </s>
<s> life was a short play of tenebrous shadows </s>
<s> david began to shave with great sweeping strokes </s>
<s> he drove sensual patterns off carefully shaving his long upper lip </s>
<s> david finished shaving washed his face clean of lather and combed and retied his hair </s>
<s> he was proud that he had never worn a wig </s>
<s> more and more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder </s>
<s> he felt cheerful again refreshed </s>
<s> presentable in his wide-cut brown suit the well-made riding boots </s>
<s> it is so easy to falsify sentiment </s>
<s> the future would happen </s>
<s> he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much </s>
<s> a man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days </s>
<s> he began to pack the saddlebags </s>
<s> burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way almost unchanged from feudal times </s>
<s> peasants puzzled andrei </s>
<s> he wondered how they could go on in poverty superstition ignorance with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish </s>
<s> andrei remembered a bathyran meeting long ago </s>
<s> tolek alterman had returned from the colonies in palestine and before the national leadership exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert </s>
<s> a fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched </s>
<s> andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference </s>
<s> it aggravated him </s>
<s> the land of the lublin uplands was rich but no one seemed to care </s>
<s> in the unfertile land in palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink </s>
<s> he had sat beside alexander brandel at the rostrum of a congress of zionists </s>
<s> all of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches </s>
<s> when alexander brandel rose to speak the hall became silent </s>
<s> we are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest seeking human dignity </s>
<s> beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren eroded hills of judea </s>
<s> this is our singular goal </s>
<s> where we end our journey is always the same </s>
<s> this was how alexander brandel expressed pure zionism </s>
<s> it had sounded good to andrei but he did not believe it </s>
<s> in his heart he had no desire to go to palestine </s>
<s> he loathed the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright </s>
<s> and now andrei sat on a train on the way to lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief </s>
<s> warsaw </s>
<s> he saw the smug eyes of the home army chief roman and all the romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him </s>
<s> once there had been big glittering rooms where ulanys bowed and kissed the ladies hands as they flirted from behind their fans </s>
<s> warsaw </s>
<s> warsaw </s>
<s> he ground his teeth together </s>
<s> i hate warsaw he said to himself </s>
<s> i hate poland and all the goddamned mothers sons of them </s>
<s> all of poland is a coffin </s>
<s> the terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind </s>
<s> only palestine and i will never live to see palestine because i did not believe </s>
<s> by late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at lublin which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the russian front </s>
<s> at a siding another train which was a familiar sight these days </s>
<s> deportees </s>
<s> jews </s>
<s> they were not poles </s>
<s> he guessed by their appearance that they were rumanians </s>
<s> he walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with styka </s>
<s> of all the places in poland andrei hated lublin the most </s>
<s> the bathyrans were all gone </s>
<s> few of the native jews who had lived in lublin were still in the ghetto </s>
<s> from the moment of the occupation lublin became a focal point </s>
<s> he and ana watched it carefully </s>
<s> lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere </s>
<s> the bathyrans ran a check on globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with hans frank and the civilian administrators </s>
<s> a bevy of interlacing lagers work camps concentration camps erupted in the area </s>
<s> plans went in and out of lublin indicating german confusion </s>
<s> ice baths electric shocks lashings wild dogs testicle crushers </s>
<s> lublin was their heart </s>
<s> as the camp emptied it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around lublin then by deportees from outside poland </s>
<s> in and in and in they poured through the gates of majdanek but they never left and majdanek was not growing any larger </s>
<s> andrei stopped at litowski place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings </s>
<s> his watch told him he was still early </s>
<s> down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall </s>
<s> he found an empty bench opened a newspaper and stretched his legs before him </s>
<s> krakow boulevard was filled with black nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their auxiliaries </s>
<s> andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the mustached homely face of sergeant styka </s>
<s> styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly </s>
<s> styka studied his captain </s>
<s> he almost broke into tears </s>
<s> to him andrei androfski had always been the living symbol of a polish officer </s>
<s> his captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby </s>
<s> styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously </s>
<s> styka grumbled about fate </s>
<s> i got a girl in trouble and we had to get married </s>
<s> not a bad girl </s>
<s> so we have three children and responsibilities </s>
<s> i work at the granary </s>
<s> nothing like the old days in the army but i get by </s>
<s> many times i tried to reach you but i never knew how </s>
<s> styka blew his nose again </s>
<s> andrei asked </s>
<s> i did exactly as instructed </s>
<s> perhaps perhaps there is a shred of conscience left in the human race </s>
<s> styka shook his head slowly </s>
<s> i cannot think things out too well </s>
<s> until i was transferred into the seventh ulanys i was like every other pole in my feeling about jews </s>
<s> i hated you when i first came in </s>
<s> what i mean is he was a pole and the greatest soldier in the ulanys </s>
<s> hell sir </s>
<s> the men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name </s>
<s> andrei smiled </s>
<s> the men of your company would not allow your name dishonored </s>
<s> all i ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country </s>
<s> the question frightened andrei </s>
<s> it was an answer that styka understood </s>
<s> grabski sat in a sweat-saturated undershirt cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown </s>
<s> he was a square brick of a man with a moon-round face and sunken polish features </s>
<s> flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread </s>
<s> half of it dripped down his chin </s>
<s> he washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch </s>
<s> andrei demanded </s>
<s> grabski looked at the pair of them </s>
<s> he can make you work papers </s>
<s> it will take a few days </s>
<s> i will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew </s>
<s> grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl </s>
<s> andrei shrugged </s>
<s> andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes </s>
<s> grabski had never seen so much money </s>
<s> his broad flat fingers petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying snatched the bills clumsily </s>
<s> andrei and styka were silent </s>
<s> she was getting real dramatic </s>
<s> it was just me and eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because i wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch </s>
<s> drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me </s>
<s> i was crazy about her all over again </s>
<s> it was the call of the wild all right </s>
<s> that evening turned out to be hell like all the others </s>
<s> we moved down broadway from ginmill to ginmill </s>
<s> it was the same old routine </s>
<s> i hate it </s>
<s> she got so drunk i had to take her home </s>
<s> it was a walk up on hudson street </s>
<s> the place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use </s>
<s> i had to shake her to make her listen </s>
<s> suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic </s>
<s> we are above being jealous </s>
<s> she began to laugh </s>
<s> she was still laughing when i grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed </s>
<s> waking up was horrible </s>
<s> we both had hangovers </s>
<s> she lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot </s>
<s> i was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when i smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell </s>
<s> there was somebody else in the apartment </s>
<s> i stiffened </s>
<s> i turned around with the percolator in my hand </s>
<s> my eyes were so bleary i could barely see him but there he was a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora </s>
<s> brown eyes eyebrow mustache </s>
<s> oval face without an expression in the world </s>
<s> she gave the nastiest laugh i ever heard </s>
<s> she was enjoying the situation </s>
<s> imagine that </s>
<s> eileen was a psychologist all right </s>
<s> instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard i found myself having a fellowfeeling for him </s>
<s> maybe he felt the same way </s>
<s> i never felt such a lowdown hound in my life </s>
<s> first thing i knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and i was handing eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers </s>
<s> all she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever </s>
<s> she never said a word about the fifty dollars </s>
<s> she added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking </s>
<s> i must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times </s>
<s> afterwards i learned that eileen had called thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about thelma trying to take her husband away </s>
<s> that finished me with thelma </s>
<s> trust eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation </s>
<s> and there i was shacked up with eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on hudson street </s>
<s> i use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship </s>
<s> what i did know was that precious was always around </s>
<s> he slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs </s>
<s> i said sure that was what i wanted her to do but she paid no attention </s>
<s> to be on the safe side i never let eileen get out of my sight day or night </s>
<s> precious had me worried </s>
<s> he was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his selfeffacing manner </s>
<s> still he let eileen treat him like a valet </s>
<s> whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was precious who did the work </s>
<s> i never could find out what his business was </s>
<s> he always seemed to have money in his pocket </s>
<s> the phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger </s>
<s> now and then he would disappear for several days </s>
<s> when i was in liquor i rode him pretty hard i guess </s>
<s> getting drunk every night was the only way i could handle the situation </s>
<s> eileen seemed to feel the same way </s>
<s> we still had that much in common </s>
<s> the trouble was drinking cost money </s>
<s> the way eileen and i were hitting it up we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening </s>
<s> eileen must have wheedled a little out of precious </s>
<s> he was a big thick beefy violent man </s>
<s> now pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly but he was a good churchgoing catholic and he loved his little sister </s>
<s> pat took eileen and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again </s>
<s> now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of mischief </s>
<s> it had gone big with the hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of art and apparel </s>
<s> all evening eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion </s>
<s> it just about blew us both out of the water when eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with </s>
<s> pat meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment </s>
<s> greatest thing that ever happened </s>
<s> before he left town pat saw to it that i was fixed up with a job </s>
<s> pat had contacts all over the labor movement </s>
<s> the portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves </s>
<s> most of them were elderly men </s>
<s> it was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of new york </s>
<s> one reason the portwatchers let sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen </s>
<s> sposato needed a front some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the redhook local </s>
<s> for once radicalism was a recommendation </s>
<s> with my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance i certainly looked the honest working stiff </s>
<s> the things a man will do for a woman </s>
<s> there was one fact which rector could not overlook one truth which he could not deny </s>
<s> as long as there were two human beings working together on the same project there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave </s>
<s> no matter how devoted a man was no matter how fully he gave his life to the lord he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual </s>
<s> it was only natural that fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions </s>
<s> he was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego demanding to be satisfied for the two were intertwined and could not be separated </s>
<s> he wanted desperately to see kayabashi defeated the communists in the village rooted out the mission standing triumphant for in the triumph of the lord he himself would be triumphant too </s>
<s> he sighed </s>
<s> how foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice </s>
<s> he would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory however it was brought about would be sweet indeed </s>
<s> his first move was to send hino to the village to spend a few days </s>
<s> his arm had been giving him some trouble and rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse </s>
<s> in any event rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what kayabashi was planning </s>
<s> hino was elated at the prospect </s>
<s> he left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday nodding attentively as rector gave him his final instructions </s>
<s> he was to get involved in no arguments </s>
<s> he was to try to make no converts </s>
<s> he was simply to listen and report back what he heard </s>
<s> it was a ridiculous situation and rector knew it for hino frankly partisan openly gregarious would make a poor espionage agent </s>
<s> if he wanted to know anything he would end up asking about it point-blank but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection </s>
<s> in all of his experience in the mission field rector had never seen a convert quite like hino </s>
<s> he had already been studying the bible </s>
<s> he knew the fundamentals and after studying with fletcher for a time he approached rector announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that </s>
<s> hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject </s>
<s> putting the pieces of this mosaic together rector had the vague outlines of a biography </s>
<s> hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast in chiba and divided his life between the land and the sea supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat </s>
<s> rector was often curious </s>
<s> often tempted to ask questions but he never did </s>
<s> if and when hino decided to tell him about his experiences he would do so unasked </s>
<s> rector had no doubt that hino would come back from the village bursting with information ready to impart it with his customary gusto liberally embellished with his active imagnation </s>
<s> he was even more startled when he heard what kayabashi wanted </s>
<s> the oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries the secretary said businessmen from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi wished to show them the mission </s>
<s> they had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it </s>
<s> rector said </s>
<s> he had something more to say </s>
<s> rector laughed despite himself </s>
<s> rector had no idea why kayabashi wanted to visit the mission </s>
<s> for the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all the available information it was probably the latter </s>
<s> kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village </s>
<s> at the same time it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity </s>
<s> no kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived </s>
<s> when he had given the call a few moments thought he went into the kitchen to ask mrs yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors using the formal english china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission then he went outside to inspect the grounds </s>
<s> fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn </s>
<s> rector asked him to move it for the time being </s>
<s> he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless </s>
<s> a good initial impression would be important now </s>
<s> he went into the print shop where fletcher had just finished cleaning the press </s>
<s> rector said </s>
<s> he did not wish to deceive kayabashi exactly just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner </s>
<s> fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things rector requested </s>
<s> he beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside </s>
<s> he told her of the visitors and then of his plans </s>
<s> he said </s>
<s> she looked back toward the schoolroom </s>
<s> the little ito girl had had to go home </s>
<s> i want to create the impression of a compound full of children </s>
<s> mavis smiled </s>
<s> as rector was walking back toward the residential hall johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him </s>
<s> the altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits but he was still a little wary around rector for they had not yet discussed the incident </s>
<s> he looked out over the expanse of the compound </s>
<s> it was going to take a lot of activity to fill it </s>
<s> he said </s>
<s> konishi can help you </s>
<s> he went on to explain what he had in mind </s>
<s> johnson nodded </s>
<s> he said he could do it </s>
<s> rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall </s>
<s> it was rather a childish game all in all but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much </s>
<s> he was not sure what effect it would have but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it </s>
<s> he was not going to lose the mission by default and whatever reason kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission he was going to be in for a surprise </s>
<s> he found elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall and then to take charge of the office while the party was here </s>
<s> then rector attired in his best blue serge suit sat in a chair out on the lawn in the shade of a tree smoking a cigarette and waiting </s>
<s> the air was cooler here and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass an effect which he found pleasant </s>
<s> she concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient </s>
<s> the fish took the bait </s>
<s> but when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement </s>
<s> she was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed </s>
<s> claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose </s>
<s> she wrote again and now abandoning for the moment the theme of love she asked for help in the matter of her career </s>
<s> she could act and she could write </s>
<s> at last he consented to meet her and following that brief interview claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal </s>
<s> on thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles </s>
<s> there we shall be free and unknown </s>
<s> we can return the following morning </s>
<s> she opened his reply with trembling fingers he agreed </s>
<s> and he would see her that evening </s>
<s> victory at last </s>
<s> there was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and as claire rose to go he asked her to sing him one song before she left </s>
<s> she had never sung better </s>
<s> and so they went he choosing of all places an inn near medmenham abbey scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the hellfire club </s>
<s> each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this it seems was not employed for self-flagellation </s>
<s> naked girls danced in the chancel of the abbey the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities </s>
<s> the jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish </s>
<s> the casual seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison </s>
<s> they passed close by the turn to bishopsgate </s>
<s> a scant half mile away shelley and mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace the air about them scented with stock and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden </s>
<s> alone with the fabulous byron </s>
<s> how many women had longed for the privilege that was hers </s>
<s> how was she to behave claire wondered </s>
<s> to be passive to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd </s>
<s> and while her adonis did not suffer from inexperience satiety might well be an equal handicap </s>
<s> no she would not pretend modesty but neither must she be crudely bold </s>
<s> in the bedroom she would insist on darkness </s>
<s> with his club foot he might well be grateful </s>
<s> the place was evidently a familiar haunt and claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown </s>
<s> the fire in the sitting room was lighted </s>
<s> byron inquired </s>
<s> so not only had he been here before but it seemed he might well come again </s>
<s> claire felt suddenly small and cheap heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of don juan </s>
<s> a cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port </s>
<s> as they waited for supper they sat by the fire glasses in hand while byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers </s>
<s> that would be minerva i suppose </s>
<s> byron laughed </s>
<s> for a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind </s>
<s> she was striking the right note </s>
<s> no man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed with one so favored flattery could hardly seem overdone </s>
<s> the light supper over claire went to him and slipping an arm about his shoulder sat on his knee </s>
<s> he drew her close and hand on cheek turned her face to his </s>
<s> her lips moist and parted spoke his name </s>
<s> his hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown </s>
<s> then to better purpose he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers untied it </s>
<s> the bodice beneath was buttoned and withdrawing his lips from hers he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it unhurriedly as if she were a child </s>
<s> but kindled by his kiss his caressing hand her desire was aflame </s>
<s> she sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom </s>
<s> lord byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color </s>
<s> he drank slowly with due appreciation </s>
<s> it was an excellent vintage </s>
<s> he rose and went to the bedroom </s>
<s> as he declaimed the sonorous measures it was as much as claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings </s>
<s> demanded mary </s>
<s> with a pardonable irony shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter </s>
<s> alastor was published only to be savagely attacked contemptuously ignored </s>
<s> shelley sent a copy to southey a former friend and another to godwin </s>
<s> neither acknowledged the gift </s>
<s> she understood completely </s>
<s> not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation </s>
<s> there will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of alastor </s>
<s> there are some even now </s>
<s> the lordly poet was at low-water mark </s>
<s> the careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent </s>
<s> on all sides doors were being slammed in his face </s>
<s> the previous scandals gaily diverting as they were had only served to increase his popularity </s>
<s> he tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister but he soon saw as did she that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin </s>
<s> for the moment there was no woman in his life and it was this vacuum that had given claire her opportunity </s>

<s> beckworth left the tent </s>
<s> below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank </s>
<s> he glanced back </s>
<s> the colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs methodically tearing at his thumbnail </s>
<s> the bombproof was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth </s>
<s> it stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank </s>
<s> from the outside it seemed no more than a low drumlin a lump on the dark earth </s>
<s> a crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor </s>
<s> two slits enabled observers to watch across the river </s>
<s> the place smelled strongly of rank fertile earth rotting wood and urine </s>
<s> at least the union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle </s>
<s> there was no place to sit but watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams </s>
<s> in the corner was the soldier with the white flag </s>
<s> he stood stiffly erect clutching the staff his body half hidden by the limp cloth </s>
<s> watson hardly looked at him </s>
<s> the man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant brandishing the flag of truce </s>
<s> someone had hauled him over the side and he had remained silent while they crossed </s>
<s> an officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank </s>
<s> the men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer two of them calling him billy </s>

<s> watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof </s>
<s> the officer had told him that both lists must be checked </s>
<s> watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass </s>
<s> the officer surprised said he would have to see </s>
<s> watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later </s>
<s> he had peered through the darkness at the rampart </s>
<s> the men he would take back across the river stood there but he turned away from them </s>
<s> he wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt </s>
<s> he had hoped to be alone in the bombproof but the soldier had followed him </s>
<s> though watson carefully ignored the man he could not deny his presence </s>
<s> perhaps it would be better to speak to him since silence could not exorcise his form </s>
<s> watson glanced briefly at him seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner </s>
<s> if my pass is approved i may be a half hour </s>
<s> the soldier answered in a curious muffled voice his lips barely moving </s>
<s> he had acknowledged the man </s>
<s> it was easier to think now watson decided </s>
<s> the stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts </s>
<s> he paced slowly stooping staring at the damp slippery floor </s>
<s> he tried to order the words of the three union officers seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy </s>
<s> but he groped blindly </s>
<s> his lack of success steadily eroded his interest </s>
<s> he stopped pacing leaned against the dank timbered wall and let his mind drift </s>
<s> a feeling of futility an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known seeped through him </s>
<s> he grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion </s>
<s> he was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity </s>
<s> hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank </s>
<s> prompted by a guilty urge he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected </s>
<s> to tell john something he would find out for himself </s>
<s> the figure in the corner belched loudly a deep liquid eruption </s>
<s> watson snorted and then laughed aloud </s>
<s> exactly </s>
<s> he clutched the staff and his dark eyes blinked apologetically </s>
<s> watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds </s>
<s> to his left the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank </s>
<s> the flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current </s>
<s> a soldier held the end of a frayed rope </s>
<s> three union guards appeared carrying their rifles at ready </s>
<s> watson stared at them curiously </s>
<s> they were stocky men well fed and clean-shaven with neat uniforms and sturdy boots </s>
<s> behind them shambled a long column of weak tattered men </s>
<s> the thin gray figures raised a hoarse cawing cry like the call of a bird flock </s>
<s> they moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness elbowing and shoving </s>
<s> four men were knocked down but did not attempt to rise </s>
<s> they crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats </s>
<s> the union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs </s>
<s> the crawling men tried to rise and fell again </s>
<s> no one moved to them </s>
<s> watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly </s>
<s> in a confused soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms the two men were dragged into the same skiff </s>
<s> the third crawling man forced himself erect </s>
<s> he swayed like a drunkard his arms milling in slow circles </s>
<s> he paced forward unsteadily leaning too far back his head tilted oddly </s>
<s> his steps were short and stiff and with his head thrown back his progress was a supercilious strut </s>
<s> he appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom </s>
<s> he stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge his weight nearly swamping the craft </s>
<s> watson looked for the fourth man </s>
<s> he had reached the three passive guards </s>
<s> he crept in an incertain manner patting the ground before him </s>
<s> the guards did not look at him </s>
<s> the figure on the earth halted seemingly bewildered </s>
<s> he sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound </s>
<s> then he began to crawl again </s>
<s> watson watched the creeping figure </s>
<s> he felt a spectator interest </s>
<s> if only there was a clock for him to crawl against </s>
<s> if he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes say then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud </s>
<s> say three minutes to make it sporting </s>
<s> still the guards did not move but stood inert aloof from the slow-scrambling man </s>
<s> the figure halted and watson gasped </s>
<s> the man began to creep in the wrong direction deceived by a slight rise in the ground </s>
<s> he turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart </s>
<s> watson raced for him his boots slamming the soft earth </s>
<s> the guards came to life with astonishing menace </s>
<s> they spun and flung their rifles up </s>
<s> watson gesticulated wildly </s>
<s> one man dropped to his knee for better aim </s>
<s> the guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at watson with sullen puzzled faces </s>
<s> watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped panting heavily </s>
<s> beneath his clutch a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone </s>
<s> watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet </s>
<s> watson stared into a cadaverous face </s>
<s> two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids </s>
<s> not like us fellas </s>
<s> it raises the voice bein in camp </s>
<s> come on now </s>
<s> i can walk real good </s>
<s> watson stumbled down the bank </s>
<s> he was no heavier than a child </s>
<s> watson paused for breath </s>
<s> his sweet whisper came after great effort </s>
<s> i wish you was henry </s>
<s> he promised to take me </s>
<s> watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff </s>
<s> the man swayed on a thwart turning his ruined eyes from side to side </s>
<s> watson turned away sickened for the first time in many months </s>
<s> he heard the patient voice calling </s>
<s> watson snatched a deep breath </s>
<s> he had not meant to shout </s>
<s> he stood with his back to the skiff </s>
<s> the men mewed and scratched begging to be taken away </s>
<s> watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches </s>
<s> intelligence jabbed at him accusingly </s>
<s> he was angry sickened </s>
<s> he had not felt that during the afternoon </s>
<s> no nor later </s>
<s> all his emotions had been inward self-conscious </s>
<s> in war on a night like this it was only the outward emotions that mattered what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> that was it </s>
<s> he was sure of it </s>
<s> what a fool he had been to think of his brother </s>
<s> so charles was dead </s>
<s> his name had been crossed off a list </s>
<s> already his cool body lay in the ground </s>
<s> men were slaughtered every day tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute </s>
<s> to hell with john </s>
<s> john would curse </s>
<s> watson spat on the ground </s>
<s> he was grimly satisfied </s>
<s> now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering </s>
<s> but the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge </s>

<s> it bulks under a veil of thin new grass like some embarrassing fact of physicalness and i think mrs pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning </s>

<s> she was a pale woman </s>
<s> sitting on her terrace sitting in her parlor sitting anywhere she ground an axe of self-esteem </s>
<s> these trumps were more touching than they were anything else and seemed to imply that the nights were long her children ungrateful and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare </s>

<s> leaving her house one late afternoon mrs pastern stopped to admire the october light </s>
<s> it was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis </s>
<s> mrs pastern had been given sixteen names a bundle of literature and a printed book of receipts </s>
<s> it was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks </s>
<s> her house stood on a rise of ground and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below </s>
<s> charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal and almost every roof she saw signified charity </s>
<s> mrs balcolm worked for the brain </s>

<s> mrs trenchard worked for the blind </s>
<s> mrs horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat </s>
<s> mrs trempler was tuberculosis mrs surcliffe was mothers march of dimes mrs craven was cancer and mrs gilkson did the kidney </s>
<s> mrs pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer </s>
<s> it was her destiny </s>
<s> it was her life </s>
<s> her mother had done it before her and even her old grandmother who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers </s>
<s> mrs pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance and most of them were ready for her </s>
<s> she experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias </s>
<s> here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry </s>
<s> the contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year and while the money of course was not hers it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks </s>
<s> she stopped at the surcliffes after dusk and had a scotch-and-soda </s>
<s> she stayed too late and when she left it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband </s>
<s> he was tired he had his business worries and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day </s>
<s> he was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the blevins thinking that they might give him a drink </s>
<s> but the blevins were away </s>
<s> their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door </s>
<s> turning in at the flannagans driveway he tried to remember if he had ever met them </s>
<s> the name encouraged him because he always felt that he could handle the irish </s>
<s> there was a glass pane in the front door and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers </s>
<s> she took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and walking with very small steps started toward the door </s>
<s> the girlish voice was nearly a whisper </s>
<s> she was not a girl he could see </s>
<s> her hair was dyed and her bloom was fading and she must have been crowding forty but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight </s>
<s> a fire had just been lighted he saw and things had been set out for drinks and like any stray his response to these comforts was instantaneous </s>
<s> where was mr flannagan he wondered </s>
<s> at the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers and she began to riffle these making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation </s>
<s> her voice dropped </s>
<s> all in all they had six drinks </s>
<s> she described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly </s>
<s> mr flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors </s>
<s> he travelled all over the world </s>
<s> planes made her feel faint and in tokyo where she had gone that summer she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home </s>
<s> she and her husband had formerly lived in new york where she had many friends but mr flannagan thought the country would be safer in case of war </s>
<s> she would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom </s>
<s> she had no children </s>
<s> she had made no friends </s>
<s> the thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him although he was even more touched by her plumpness </s>
<s> sheer plumpness he knew is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions </s>
<s> it serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass </s>
<s> her voice shook with feeling and he thought it lovely </s>
<s> mrs pastern asked sadly when he came in </s>
<s> charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the tv room to hear the news </s>
<s> he shouted </s>
<s> but in bed he had trouble sleeping </s>
<s> he thought first of his son and daughter away at college </s>
<s> he loved them </s>
<s> it was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known </s>
<s> then he played nine imaginary holes of golf choosing his handicap his irons his stance his opponents and his weather in detail but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries </s>
<s> his money was tied up in a nassau hotel an ohio pottery works and a detergent for window-washing and luck had been running against him </s>
<s> his worries harried him up out of bed and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window </s>
<s> in the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves </s>
<s> during the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying like leaves in the gutters near belmont and saratoga </s>
<s> maple and ash beech and elm one hundred to win on three in the fourth fifty to win on six in the third one hundred to win on two in the eighth </s>
<s> children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage </s>
<s> then getting back into bed he thought unashamedly of mrs flannagan planning where they would next meet and what they would do </s>
<s> it was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years not since their last journey eastward to witness their uncle izaak being lowered into the rocky soil </s>
<s> her thoughts were not discrete </s>
<s> but there was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons </s>
<s> she grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright like a bird alert for flight </s>
<s> she turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray </s>
<s> there she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters one to abel one to mark </s>
<s> once her trembling hand with the pen grasped tight in it was pressed against the paper the words came sharply smoothly as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips </s>
<s> and the stiffly regal look of them she saw grimly lacked the quaver of age which thwarting the efforts of her amazing will ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string </s>
<s> i should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters </s>
<s> she signed the letters quickly stamped them and placed them on the hall table for raphael to mail in town </s>
<s> then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water </s>
<s> she looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years </s>
<s> from the early evening lights of them which had first startled izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way they had faded to a near-absence of color which had possibly from her constant looking at the water something of the light of the sea in them </s>
<s> angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth </s>
<s> she smiled and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face </s>
<s> her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose </s>
<s> angelina stepped back her eyes roaming the tray for omissions </s>
<s> then she looked at the old woman again her eyes calm </s>
<s> the name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips </s>
<s> for an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile </s>
<s> she would have said triumph </s>
<s> then angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen </s>
<s> jessica packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips </s>
<s> for a moment she held her face to the empty doorway </s>
<s> then she snorted and groped for her fork </s>
<s> and indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth </s>
<s> she was the last living of the older generation </s>
<s> she swung her eyes up to the blue of the window her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans </s>
<s> she ate </s>
<s> or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years </s>
<s> she thought again of her children those two who had died young before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies </s>
<s> the girl her first she barely remembered </s>
<s> but the boy the boy had been alive yesterday </s>
<s> each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her </s>
<s> he ran on his plump sticks of legs freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs all carefully placed and glued and labeled resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire </s>
<s> in the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged quick with the delight of laughter and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her </s>
<s> it was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea </s>
<s> they rarely spoke </s>
<s> abel sat and regarded the farm country which spreading out from both sides of the road rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields </s>
<s> and it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger impervious complete in itself </s>
<s> that is what childhood is he told himself </s>
<s> solid settled lost </s>
<s> what bad grace what incredible selfishness he and mark had shown </s>
<s> the small car flew on relentlessly </s>
<s> the old woman stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality </s>
<s> abel moved and adjusted his long legs </s>
<s> not until the words had been spoken did abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness </s>
<s> he and mark were the last of the family and there lay the cape ann property which had seemed to have no end stretching from horizon to horizon in those golden days of summer </s>
<s> now abel turned his head to look at his brother </s>
<s> his sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides and abel looked quickly away </s>
<s> mark easily looked years older than himself settled his world comfortably categorized </s>
<s> the vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea </s>
<s> he gave abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel hugging it to him and abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt </s>
<s> abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation </s>
<s> he smiled </s>
<s> it was barely possible that his brother was right </s>
<s> he could tell they were approaching the sea </s>
<s> there was the smell of the coast like a primeval memory composed of equal parts salt water clams seaweed and northern air </s>
<s> there was the day uncle izaak had in an unexpected grandiose gesture handed over the pretty sloop to abel for keeps on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever younger the boy wished </s>
<s> the two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could </s>
<s> they seemed then to have had a single mind and body a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth casually </s>
<s> he saw the starbird as she lay her slender mast up and gently turning its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky </s>
<s> both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting ready for the two of them to run up her sails </s>
<s> the starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay </s>
<s> they came unexpectedly upon the sea </s>
<s> meeting it without preparation as they did robbed of anticipation a common disappointment seized them </s>
<s> they were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended </s>
<s> mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water which there being no moon out at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars </s>
<s> that would make him mad enough if he was sober </s>
<s> i pushed at his shoulder calling his name </s>
<s> he was a cagey sonofabitch </s>
<s> i shook him a little harder and made some noise </s>
<s> i was leaning too far over </s>
<s> i knew better </s>
<s> he always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him </s>
<s> oh he was smart </s>
<s> it put you off </s>
<s> i knew better but i was thinking of the pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough </s>
<s> when his arm came up i ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck watering my eyes and i backed off to cough </s>
<s> pa was on his side looking at me his eyes winking the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow </s>
<s> he was like a mean horse to come at from the rear </s>
<s> he was bitter when he missed </s>
<s> pa pulled at the covers </s>
<s> he was tasting his mouth </s>
<s> hans is rubbing him with snow </s>
<s> he was just lying there </s>

<s> god dammit get </s>
<s> find out something </s>
<s> both you and hans </s>
<s> pedersen </s>

<s> out </s>
<s> he was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow </s>
<s> he had long black hairs on his wrist </s>
<s> they curled around the cuff of his nightshirt </s>
<s> out </s>
<s> he was about to get up so i got out slamming the door </s>
<s> he was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep </s>
<s> then he threw things </s>
<s> once he went after hans and dumped his pot over the banister </s>
<s> hans got an axe </s>
<s> that pot put pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it </s>
<s> i always felt the memory was present in both of them stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl as eager as an animal to be out </s>
<s> i heard pa cursing all the way downstairs </s>
<s> take the axe </s>
<s> all he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face </s>
<s> nothing </s>
<s> that cock </s>
<s> ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off </s>
<s> not any more </s>
<s> not for years </s>
<s> hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her </s>
<s> if we had then one of us would have had to go instead </s>
<s> hans rubbed the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed </s>
<s> i took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch </s>
<s> oh he was being queer and careful pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm </s>
<s> there was no way of getting even </s>
<s> they were always trying so you got to expect it </s>
<s> hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap </s>
<s> pa had a knack for hiding </s>
<s> he knew we were looking and he enjoyed it </s>
<s> but now ma </s>
<s> pa was sure to find out </s>
<s> a fool could see what was going on </s>
<s> he took pride in his hiding </s>
<s> it was all the pride he had </s>
<s> i guess fooling hans and me took doing </s>
<s> hans poured some in a tumbler </s>
<s> colors on the towels had run </s>
<s> i took him by the shoulders </s>
<s> his head flopped back </s>
<s> his mouth fell open </s>
<s> the skin on his neck was tight </s>

<s> he was cold all right </s>
<s> i put my arm carefully around him </s>

<s> i had my arm behind his back </s>
<s> he was in his mid-fifties at this time long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing </s>
<s> there was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received </s>
<s> it was always the same unqualified success now </s>
<s> he could no longer build anything whether a private residence in his pennsylvania county or a church in brazil without it being obvious that he had done it and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time a quality of authentic uniqueness about them which once established by an artist as his private vision is no longer disputable as to its other values </s>

<s> he had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife a remarkably childish thing in itself </s>
<s> this was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist </s>
<s> the debris of his other careers was piled everywhere </s>
<s> a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor </s>
<s> his files desk drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos </s>
<s> everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form his models drawings ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac </s>
<s> bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the camden cycly company plant hung on a rope in one corner and over his desk next to several old and dusty hats was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house </s>
<s> sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved </s>
<s> this air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine </s>
<s> but he was not bored at all </s>
<s> he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it and he could not imagine why he should alter it </s>
<s> there are after all fortunate souls who hear everything but only know how to listen to what is good for them and stowey was as things go a fortunate man </s>
<s> but he was too busy to hear what she was saying </s>
<s> so they parted when she was in an impatient humor </s>
<s> when he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before she came out of the house with an enormous rumanian shawl over her head which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window </s>
<s> he saw the surprise in her face and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen </s>
<s> he kept on laughing until she started laughing with him </s>
<s> he had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked and good humor </s>
<s> an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it </s>
<s> he would settle himself into his seat to laugh </s>
<s> whenever he laughed it was all he was doing </s>
<s> she was forty-nine at this time a lanky woman of breeding with an austere narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer </s>
<s> her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders </s>
<s> there was an air of blindness in her gray eyes the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which besides has kept its estate intact </s>
<s> she was personally sloppy and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it soaking wet dangling from her waist and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves </s>
<s> but just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed brushed and taking breaths of air and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy a grace of history so to speak and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value </s>
<s> she even spoke differently when she was clean and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp </s>

<s> to the stump of a tree as he passed it the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed </s>

<s> she had begun to turn back toward the house but his look caught her and she stood still waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell </s>
<s> he looked at her out of himself she thought as he did only for an instant at a time the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the tate gallery on a thursday once </s>

<s> there is a death in all partings she knew and promptly put it out of her mind </s>
<s> she enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night but it always seemed to her that being alone especially alone in her house was the realest part of life </s>

<s> she could dust the plants then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on </s>
<s> improvise cha-chas on the harp </s>
<s> and finally the best part of all simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers reading the ads as well as the news registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire </s>
<s> she did this now comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows of the silence outside of the dark afternoon it was getting to be </s>
<s> she fell asleep leaning on her hand hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm </s>
<s> every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things stowey yes was on his way south and the two boys were away in school and nothing was burning on the stove and lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers </s>
<s> then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes </s>
<s> she stood up smoothing her hair down straightening her clothes feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside and above everything else for the absence of the need to answer to respond to be aware even of stowey coming in or going out and yet now that she was beginning to cook she glimpsed a future without him a future alone like this and the pain made her head writhe and in a moment she found it hard to wait for lucretia to come with her guests </s>
<s> she went into the living room and turned on three lamps then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn illuminating the driveway </s>
<s> she knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself </s>
<s> they were both so young after all so unready for any final parting </s>
<s> but yes nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen </s>
<s> she stood still over the leg of lamb rubbing herbs into it quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath a sensation of violence that started her shivering </s>
<s> so when the big house filled up and ran over the sisters-in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes </s>
<s> and there was still not anything that linda kay could do </s>
<s> so linda kay gave up asking and accepted her reprieve </s>
<s> without saying so she was really grateful </s>
<s> she had made curtains for all the windows of her little house and she had kept it spotless and neat shabby as it was and cooked good meals for bobby joe </s>
<s> she had done all the things she had promised herself she would do but she had not thought of this </s>
<s> people died she would have said in hospitals or in cars on the highway at night </s>
<s> bobby joe was gone all day now not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper </s>
<s> when they first married he had been working in the fields all day and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working to take him a fresh hot meal </s>
<s> now there was no work in the fields nor would there be till it rained and she did not know where he went </s>
<s> not that she complained or had any cause to </s>
<s> four or five of the cousins from east texas were about his age so naturally they ran around together </s>
<s> there was no reason for her to ask what they did </s>
<s> thus a new pattern of days began to develop for granny albright did not die </s>
<s> she lay still on the bed her head hardly denting the pillow </s>
<s> sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around and sometimes she took a little milk or soup </s>
<s> they stopped expecting her to die the next minute but only in the next day or two </s>
<s> those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home for she might die any time </s>
<s> but they might as well unpack their suitcases for she might linger on </s>
<s> so the pattern was established </s>
<s> when linda kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs she would go to the big house </s>
<s> there was not anything she could do there but that was where everyone was or would be </s>
<s> and sit on the porch a while </s>
<s> the older men would be there at noon and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town </s>
<s> the women and children stayed at the albrights </s>
<s> the women keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room sounded like chickens shut up in a coop for the night </s>
<s> off and on all day someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything </s>
<s> so that the rest of the house stayed open though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way </s>
<s> the dust clogged their throats and the heat parched them so that the women were always making ice water </s>
<s> they had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there </s>
<s> one afternoon as the women sat clucking softly a new carload of people pulled up at the gate </s>
<s> it was a cadillac black grayed with the dust of the road its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled </s>
<s> there was much embracing much exclaiming </s>
<s> all the women got up and offered their chairs and when they were all seated again the guests made their inquiries and their explanations </s>
<s> she filled a big pitcher and set it with glasses on a tray </s>
<s> carrying it to the living room she imagined the picture she made tall and roundly slim a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band </s>
<s> almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain at such a time in such a place and she tossed back her long yellow hair smiling shyly as she entered the room </s>
<s> she felt the look and looked back because she could not help it seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed </s>
<s> he asked when she passed him a glass </s>
<s> this joke was not funny to linda kay and she blushed as she always did </s>
<s> she asked bobby joe that night </s>
<s> thirty-five i guess </s>
<s> bobby joe was thinking about something else </s>
<s> he was talking about antelope again when they woke up </s>
<s> linda kay asked </s>
<s> almost immediately howard and his daughter debora drove up in the cadillac </s>
<s> there was really no reason to refuse and linda kay had never ridden in a cadillac </s>
<s> driving along the caliche-topped road to town howard talked </s>
<s> she was such a well-rounded teenager having been a twirler future farmers sweetheart and secretary of future homemakers </s>
<s> in her sophomore year she had started going steady with bobby joe who was a football player future homemakers sweetheart and president of future farmers </s>
<s> it was easy to see that they were made for each other and they knew what they wanted </s>
<s> bobby joe would be a senior this year and he planned to graduate </s>
<s> howard sighed </s>
<s> then he told linda kay about himself </s>
<s> it made her feel different about howard </s>
<s> she was going to tell bobby joe about how mistaken she had been but he brought one of the cousins home for supper and all they did was talk about antelope </s>
<s> bobby joe was trying to get linda kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home </s>
<s> she exclaimed </s>
<s> linda kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry </s>
<s> but they were going up to the big house after supper and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little </s>
<s> they all sat around and drank ice water and the men smoked and everybody had a good time </s>
<s> that night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting on a moonlight night </s>
<s> after they had left some of the people moved around to find more comfortable places to sit </s>
<s> there were not many chairs so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch resting their feet on the ground and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall </s>
<s> howard who had been sitting against the wall said he needed more fresh air and took the spot on the edge of the porch where bobby joe had been sitting </s>
<s> linda kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable </s>
<s> bobby joe had been sitting close to her touching her actually and holding her hand from time to time but it seemed at once that howard sat much closer </s>
<s> perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers </s>
<s> still she was not sorry he sat by her but in fact was flattered </s>
<s> he had become the center of the company such stories he had to tell </s>
<s> he had sold oil stock to bob hope and bing crosby in person </s>
<s> he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights </s>
<s> alex asked </s>
<s> the doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel room number nine to initiate alex further into these undertakings </s>
<s> inside carefully packed in straw were six eggs but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside </s>
<s> to alex they were merely six not unusual hens eggs </s>
<s> there was little enough time to contemplate them however </s>
<s> in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands thoroughly eared and big as a table top </s>
<s> below these particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed </s>
<s> it was the doctor dressed and ready for the expedition to the market and alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste </s>
<s> the doctor stood about waiting for alex to dress with a show of impatience and soon they were moving as quietly as could be through the still-dark hallways past the bedroom of the patronne and so into the street </s>
<s> he stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks he gobbled with the turkeys and they at once were all attention he quacked with the ducks and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese </s>
<s> the dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery </s>
<s> it was a fine broody hen white with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen </s>
<s> all search was ended </s>
<s> he had found his fowl </s>
<s> the clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance </s>
<s> the doctor was wearing a long new england greatcoat hardly necessary in the june weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens </s>
<s> alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who for all his care manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled </s>
<s> they advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up with gingerly steps towards the first landing </s>
<s> it was then that they heard the tread of one descending and in some perturbation glancing up saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing </s>
<s> their hostess enquired </s>
<s> alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him </s>
<s> the doctor he noticed was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well </s>
<s> with that he hurried up the stairs followed by her suspicious gaze </s>
<s> there was no reference to the incident on the stairs his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business </s>
<s> the hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them </s>
<s> one part of her audience was totally engaged the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic the other part the guest of the connoisseur attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand </s>
<s> the spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote </s>
<s> the audience attended </s>
<s> time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature </s>
<s> startled he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view and alex went to the door </s>
<s> he opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling coughing and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest </s>
<s> it was giselle the fille de chambre come to clean the room and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity explaining her errand alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird </s>
<s> giselle was reluctant but alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again </s>
<s> the doctor instantly asked </s>
<s> she looked mighty interested though </s>
<s> he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed alex in a muted voice </s>
<s> the hall was empty and alex beckoned </s>
<s> they climbed the stairs which creaked very loudly to their sensitive ears and reached the next floor </s>
<s> a guest was locking his room </s>
<s> the doctor sat down rather wearily caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry-loving man but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more </s>
<s> at the door alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes </s>
<s> they waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe </s>
<s> the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door </s>
<s> they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact </s>
<s> the doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob but to no effect the lavatory was occupied </s>
<s> although a look of alarm passed over his face he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine </s>
<s> alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat </s>
<s> unwarranted they were in any case for as he stood facing the fille de chambre his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower room </s>
<s> shortly the doctor himself entered his hair somewhat wet from the shower but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures </s>
<s> without comment he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside </s>
<s> next the hen was nested and all seemed well </s>
<s> the two men sat for some time savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings before they got up and left the hotel the doctor to go to the conference house and alex to go to the main post office </s>
<s> alex returned to the hotel rather weary and with no new prospects of a role in the late afternoon but found the doctor in an ebullient mood </s>
<s> at the time alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning </s>
<s> going downstairs with the tray winston wished he could have given in to miss ada but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little-girl look </s>
<s> but he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure </s>
<s> in the kitchen leona his little young wife was reading the morning paper </s>
<s> her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool </s>
<s> she looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper </s>
<s> his eye had fastened on her leg </s>
<s> bending he touched her knee </s>
<s> she twitched her leg away </s>
<s> then he spread out the last list on the counter </s>
<s> fine hand </s>
<s> sighing leona dropped the paper and stood up </s>
<s> winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron </s>
<s> carefully he undid the bow </s>
<s> she turned and put her arms around his neck </s>
<s> he drew back embarrassed and pleased </s>
<s> she sounded as though they already existed </s>
<s> in spite of the hundred things he had on his mind winston went and put his arm around her waist </s>
<s> all the time in the world </s>
<s> she wailed </s>
<s> too many times was the truth of it winston thought </s>
<s> he hardly believed his reason himself any more </s>
<s> although it had seemed a good reason to begin with no couple could afford to have children </s>
<s> he asked leona </s>
<s> he doubted whether she heard him over the running water </s>
<s> she made him sad some days and he was never sure why </s>
<s> it was something to do with her back the thinness of it and the quick jerky way she bent </s>
<s> she was too young that was all </s>
<s> too young and thin and straight </s>
<s> it was mr jack bellowing out in the hall </s>
<s> winston hurried through the swinging door </s>
<s> he was standing in front of the mirror tightening his tie </s>
<s> he had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat and his brief case lay on the bench </s>
<s> there were a few blades of lint on the shoulder </s>
<s> winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work </s>
<s> he gave mr jack a real going-over </s>
<s> he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long firm strokes </s>
<s> mr jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes </s>
<s> winston apologized and quickly set the hat right </s>
<s> then he stood back to look at mr jack who was pulling on his pigskin gloves </s>
<s> winston enjoyed seeing him start out </s>
<s> he wore his clothes with style </s>
<s> the velvet smoking jackets pearl-gray wine and blue which miss ada had bought him hung brushed and unworn in the closet </s>
<s> winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car </s>
<s> a handsome fine-looking man it made him proud to see </s>
<s> after mr jack drove away winston went on looking out the window </s>
<s> he noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger </s>
<s> then he looked at his finger at the wrinkled heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up slit and open </s>
<s> for the first time he be sad about the move </s>
<s> that house was ten years off his life let himself </s>
<s> each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier </s>
<s> he knew the house like a blind man through his fingers and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up </s>
<s> ten years ago he had come to the house to be interviewed </s>
<s> the tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive and he had walked up from the bus almost singing </s>
<s> miss ada had been out back in a straw hat planting flowers </s>
<s> she had talked to him right there with the hot sun in his face which made him sweat and feel ashamed </s>
<s> winston had been surprised at her for that </s>
<s> she had had a dignity about her even barefoot and almost too tan </s>
<s> since then the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill </s>
<s> already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate and the periwinkles were coming on blue by the porch steps </s>
<s> in a week the hyacinths would spike out </s>
<s> and after that the japanese cherries </s>
<s> she had dug a hole for each bulb each tree wore a tag with her writing on it </s>
<s> sighing he hurried to the living room </s>
<s> he had a thousand things to see to </s>
<s> the snail is pulling in her horns </s>
<s> in the living room miss ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand </s>
<s> she was looking out at the garden </s>
<s> winston had the big straw basket ready in the hall </s>
<s> he brought it in and put it down beside her </s>
<s> miss ada was looking fine </s>
<s> she had on her easter suit blue with lavender binding </s>
<s> halfway across the house he could have smelled her morning perfume </s>
<s> it hung in all her day clothes sweet and strong </s>
<s> sometimes when he was pressing winston raised her dresses to his face </s>
<s> frowning miss ada studied the list </s>
<s> the china lemon tree </s>
<s> neither of them trusted the movers </s>
<s> she smiled at winston and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes </s>
<s> he picked up the photograph and began to wrap it </s>
<s> winston folded the tissue paper carefully </s>
<s> and it was his main present </s>
<s> winston laid it in the basket </s>
<s> but she went on down the list </s>
<s> winston was relieved </s>
<s> those presents had been on his mind </s>
<s> he had only agreed with miss ada about getting the valet but he had actually suggested the photograph to mr jack </s>
<s> but winston had persuaded him </s>
<s> on christmas night they had had a disagreement about it </s>
<s> winston had heard because he was setting up the liquor tray in the next room </s>
<s> through the door he had seen mr jack walking around waiting for miss ada </s>
<s> finally she had come down </s>
<s> winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown </s>
<s> she had asked </s>
<s> he had stood at a little distance studying her as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head </s>
<s> miss ada had giggled and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down </s>
<s> after that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word </s>
<s> then miss ada had stood up rustling and rustling and gone upstairs </s>

<s> during the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation and delight </s>
<s> nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp the packing away of my camp uniforms the severing of ties with the six or ten people i had grown most to love in the world </s>
<s> in final separation from them in the railroad terminal across the river from new york i would nearly cry </s>
<s> my parents welcoming arms would seem woeful inadequate unwanted </s>
<s> but that year was different for just as the city in the form of my street clothes had intruded upon my mountain nights so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall jessica and i about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs had agreed to correspond </s>
<s> these letters became the center of my existence </s>
<s> i lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer </s>
<s> in my letters i took on a personality that differed from the self i knew in real life </s>
<s> then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques full of dash and wit and glamor quoting from the books i read imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special after-school class i was enrolled </s>
<s> for many nights afterward the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires would cause me to lie awake in shame tossing with irresolution longing to fall into a deep sleep </s>
<s> the weeks went by and the longer our separation grew the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became </s>
<s> they caused my love for jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again </s>
<s> as it turned out jessica took matters into her own hands </s>
<s> having received permission to give a camp reunion-halloween party she asked that i come and be her date </s>
<s> i went and mum and nervous all but made a fool of myself </s>
<s> again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates i was shy with jessie and acted as i had during those early saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom later in the privacy of our bunks we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance </s>
<s> i remember standing in a corner watching jessica act the hostess serving soft drinks to her guests </s>
<s> it made her look sweet and schoolgirlish i was excited to be with her but i did not know how to express it </s>
<s> yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages out of my mind and plant himself in reality </s>
<s> it was late we were playing kissing games and jessica and i were called on to kiss in front of the others </s>
<s> we blushed and were flustered and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek </s>
<s> the kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote exciting premonitions of lust all the mysterious sensations that i had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me </s>
<s> later we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night </s>
<s> we would write to one another and make a definite plan </s>
<s> she was terribly pleased </s>
<s> among my school and neighborhood friends during the next months i bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date </s>
<s> but though i boasted and gave off a dapper front i was beneath it all frightened </s>
<s> it would be the first time i had ever been completely alone with a girl i loved </s>
<s> all this was unknown to me and yet i had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year </s>
<s> her optimism gave me heart </s>
<s> i forced confidence into myself </s>
<s> i made inquiries i read a book of etiquette </s>
<s> in december i wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the hotel astor a rendezvous spot that i had learned was the most sophisticated </s>
<s> i set the hour of our meeting for seven </s>
<s> my camp-made leather wallet bulky with twisted raised stitches around the edges i stuffed with money i had been saving </s>
<s> hatless in an overcoat of rough blue wool i was given a proud farewell by my mother and father and i set out into the strangely still streets of brooklyn </s>
<s> i felt superior to the neighborhood friends i was leaving behind felt older than my years and was full of compliments for myself as i headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable tantalizing excitement of manhattan </s>
<s> heavy-coated severe-looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic </s>
<s> the night was cold but the crowd kept one warm </s>
<s> the giant electric signs and marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had been instituted and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner </s>
<s> his neighbors cheered him on </s>
<s> there was a great sense of camaraderie </s>
<s> it was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other gallants who had established the astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking </s>
<s> i looked over their faces and felt a twinge they all looked so much more knowing than i </s>
<s> i looked away </s>
<s> i felt for my wallet </s>
<s> its thick substantial outline calmed me </s>
<s> but when i saw that it was already ten past seven i began to wonder if something had gone wrong </s>
<s> i grew uneasy </s>
<s> all about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings taking place like abrupt jerky scenes in old silent movies joyous greetings and beginnings huggings and kissings enthusiastic forays into the festive night </s>
<s> whole platoons were taking up new positions on the steps arriving and departing while i stayed glued like a signpost to one spot </s>
<s> my heart almost stopped beating </s>
<s> there were thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning i left for hanover most of them disturbed and hallucinating </s>
<s> an interne a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us </s>
<s> it seemed incredible as i listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients that technically i was a ward of the state of illinois going to a hospital for the mentally ill </s>
<s> i suddenly thought of mary jane brennan the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger her quiet competence the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses </s>
<s> we had become good friends during my stay at cook county hospital </s>
<s> she knew that i lived at a good address on the gold coast that i had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies </s>
<s> she knew also that i was unmarried and without a single known relative </s>
<s> this had worried her </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> nonsense </s>
<s> she met my eyes suddenly angry </s>
<s> we keep getting the same ones back again and again </s>
<s> they all mean well have great promises to make when they are about to go home but drinking is their sickness </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> her eyes flashed angrily </s>
<s> there was no money for tuition for clothes for all the things you apparently take for granted </s>
<s> they even pay me six dollars a month </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> aunt mary died when i was doing my military service </s>
<s> something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face </s>
<s> her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother aunts and uncles cousins </s>
<s> listening i felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can </s>
<s> when she had finished i said </s>
<s> i knew that </s>
<s> it was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there </s>
<s> now riding this hospital bus feeling isolated and utterly alone i knew that she was genuine and unique quite unlike any girl i had known before </s>
<s> it seemed the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me </s>
<s> it was a fantastic story </s>
<s> only two people in the state of illinois knew that i was entering hanover state hospital under an assumed name or why </s>
<s> it was unlikely that any girl as sharp as mary jane brennan would believe it without proof </s>
<s> but i had the proof all documented in a legal agreement which i would show her the moment i was free to do so </s>
<s> as the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward hanover i settled back in my seat and closed my eyes thinking over the events of the past two weeks trying to put the pieces in order </s>
<s> i wondered suddenly as i listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the patient behind me if i had not perhaps imagined it all </s>
<s> perhaps this was reality and dale nelson the actor was delusion </s>
<s> four </s>
<s> i had come to chicago from new york early in september with a dramatic production called ask tony </s>
<s> it was a bad play real grade-a turkey which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal </s>
<s> no one not even the producer had any real hope of getting it back to broadway </s>
<s> but because it was a suspense gangster story of the capone era many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in chicago continue as a road company and eventually become a movie </s>
<s> such optimism was completely unjustified </s>
<s> the critics literally screamed their indignation </s>
<s> ask tony was doomed from the moment kupcinet leveled on it in his sun-times column </s>
<s> we opened on friday and closed the following monday </s>
<s> out of the entire cast i alone received good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer </s>
<s> this let me in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company two members of which were native chicagoans </s>
<s> we were paid off tuesday morning and given tickets back to new york </s>
<s> i felt lonely and depressed as i packed my bags at the croydon hotel </s>
<s> it seemed to me that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another </s>
<s> then later i had quit my safe secure five-a-week spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play </s>
<s> it seemed to me that i was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well </s>
<s> it suddenly occurred to me that i did not particularly like acting that i was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what i was going to do with my life </s>
<s> i closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up then went to the bathroom for a drink of water </s>
<s> the telephone rang </s>
<s> i smiled </s>
<s> i started to say something else appropriate but the man had hung up </s>
<s> i finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over the untimely passing of ask tony </s>
<s> they all bowed low as i approached them </s>
<s> i laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round </s>
<s> he had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me </s>
<s> i walked over to him </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> i followed him out through the lobby to the street </s>

<s> the elderly chauffeur immaculate in a dark uniform stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of the town car </s>
<s> i was giving the parked cars the once-over </s>
<s> i walked with him back to the entrance </s>
<s> he gave me a ticket on the agency car and parked it </s>
<s> i was back in ten minutes </s>
<s> i went back to the agency car and got out an electric bug one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing </s>
<s> i always keep a set in the car </s>
<s> the attendant waved me on </s>
<s> one of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street trying to make himself inconspicuous keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting </s>
<s> you want to sit down </s>
<s> your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary </s>
<s> i waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building </s>
<s> he came out alone </s>
<s> i kept trying to get him to take my money </s>
<s> i know where the car is </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> i hurried over to the agency heap jumped in started the motor and was just in time to see the car i wanted to shadow turn to the left </s>
<s> i was held up a bit trying to make a left turn </s>
<s> traffic was pretty heavy </s>
<s> i turned on the electric bug and the signal came in loud and clear </s>
<s> i made time and picked him up within ten blocks </s>
<s> i stayed half a block behind him letting lots of cars keep in between us listening to the steady beep beep beep </s>
<s> after fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left </s>
<s> if it ever got behind me the beep turned to a buzz </s>
<s> i turned left too soon and got a signal showing that i was still behind him but he was to the right </s>
<s> after a while the signal became a buzz and i knew he was behind me </s>
<s> i made a big circle until i located the car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house </s>
<s> i found a parking place half a block away sat in the car and waited </s>
<s> my quarry was in the apartment house for two hours </s>
<s> then he came out and started driving toward the beach </s>
<s> by this time it was dark </s>
<s> his signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz </s>
<s> i circled the block and found he was in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant </s>
<s> i sat where i could watch the exit and realized i was hungry </s>
<s> i sat there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching the aroma of coffee </s>
<s> my man came out an hour later drove to the beach turned right and after half a mile went to the swim and tan motel </s>
<s> it was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front </s>
<s> i remembered it was the peeping tom place </s>
<s> i waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before i went in to register </s>
<s> the card the man i was shadowing had filled out was still on the counter </s>
<s> he had written out the license number of his car but had transposed the last two figures an old dodge which is still good </s>
<s> i used the alias of robert c richards gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap but a couple of phony numbers in between </s>
<s> i could have written anything </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> there are ice cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office </s>
<s> the construction was reasonably solid </s>
<s> not like the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment </s>
<s> i put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side i wanted to case </s>
<s> with the aid of that i could hear my man moving around heard him cough a couple of times heard the toilet flush heard the sound of water running </s>
<s> whoever his companion was going to be she was going to join him later </s>
<s> she knew where to come </s>
<s> i was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed </s>
<s> i had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile </s>
<s> the batteries on the bugging device i had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals </s>
<s> the powerful microphone i could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation and i was positively nauseated i was so hungry </s>
<s> i got in the car drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible </s>
<s> she asked </s>
<s> i reached over and switched off the electronic bugging device </s>
<s> then i shut off the device again </s>
<s> she wanted to hang around while i was eating </s>
<s> she looked at me provocatively </s>
<s> i turned on the device again half fearful that i might find silence but the buzzes came in loud and clear </s>
<s> when i switched on the lights for her to come and get the check i had the exact change plus a dollar tip </s>
<s> the gun moved </s>
<s> roberta and dave began to back toward the door </s>
<s> the thin man waved the gun again </s>
<s> at the door dave paused to feel for the latch </s>
<s> roberta glanced up at her husband </s>
<s> he was going to be sensible and not try to do anything rash with that gun pointed at him </s>
<s> she measured the distance from where they stood to the men and the gun measured the distance from the men to the back room </s>
<s> she decided to risk it </s>
<s> dave had the latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open </s>
<s> in a flash she was away to the back paying no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats </s>
<s> she tore open the back door </s>
<s> it was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top </s>
<s> there was a small sideboard with some empty beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs </s>
<s> slowly she turned to face the men again </s>
<s> rat-face at the counter was on his feet </s>
<s> the distance between where she stood and where dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles </s>
<s> keeping her frightened gaze on the men at the counter she began to feel her way to the door </s>
<s> she sidled along the booths one step at a time </s>
<s> the gun followed her </s>
<s> as she reached dave and felt his arm go around her felt him pull her to the safety of his person she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to lauren </s>
<s> the two men watched as dave closed the door behind them watched them cross the sidewalk to their car </s>
<s> it was getting light </s>
<s> the fat man removed his apron put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket and zipped it over his paunch </s>
<s> the thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a number </s>
<s> vince </s>
<s> he turned from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant </s>
<s> good </s>
<s> a line of worry formed a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side </s>
<s> vince swore </s>
<s> grosse muttered his head down one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket </s>
<s> but he was aware of it just the same </s>
<s> he knew vince steiner was one of those men who had to work up a fury once in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be </s>
<s> with a curse vince seized the thing nearest a glass sugar container with a spouted metal top and threw it against the wall opposite </s>
<s> sugar sprayed with a hiss that was loud in the silence </s>
<s> not really startled but careful to appear so grosse sucked noisily on his pipe </s>
<s> vince cursed steadily </s>
<s> grosse quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar </s>
<s> vince watched him </s>
<s> his mouth worked over the profanity the obscenities in his vocabulary </s>
<s> he got one of the menus and brushed the spilled sugar onto it and carried it to a box on the floor behind the counter </s>
<s> he returned the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser </s>
<s> he spoke soothingly </s>
<s> grosse tucked the gun under the counter </s>
<s> vince swore again </s>
<s> the fat man winced </s>
<s> he ran a finger down his cheek tracing the scratch there </s>
<s> the thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at the clock </s>
<s> grosse spread his hands </s>
<s> grosse swore now </s>
<s> grosse rubbed the bridge of his nose where it was swollen </s>
<s> he spoke sullenly </s>
<s> suddenly he grinned </s>
<s> his voice lost its sullen tones and he chuckled </s>
<s> impatiently </s>
<s> vince lifted his hand as if to strike but his thin lips spread in a smile </s>
<s> grosse ducked and sniggered </s>
<s> lauren landis rubbed her face against the blanket </s>
<s> she had cried a little because she was frightened </s>
<s> it was one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had gone on home without you </s>
<s> she was glad the fat man had left </s>
<s> barney was not really frightening </s>
<s> she jumped as the little man now appeared at the window and reaching through the opening offered her a bottle of coke </s>
<s> she smiled at him wetly </s>
<s> he placed a bottle opener on the counter </s>
<s> so he understood her panic </s>
<s> she blew her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle </s>
<s> it was icy cold and tasted delicious </s>
<s> she felt a lift in spirit </s>
<s> when she was finished she pushed it back </s>
<s> still no answer </s>
<s> he seemed to be looking at a point above the little window </s>
<s> barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking </s>
<s> he dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe </s>
<s> now he looked at her </s>
<s> but he was back at work on a car </s>
<s> she dropped her head on her arms on the counter </s>
<s> her heart was thumping painfully </s>
<s> something wet and hot was trickling on her wrists </s>
<s> with a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself </s>
<s> as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation she was in she would think about something else </s>
<s> her mother and father for instance </s>
<s> in her mind she followed the white buick along the road somewhere between here and the niagara river </s>
<s> her mother would be fast asleep curled up against that wonderful big safe solid shoulder next to her on the front seat </s>
<s> lauren landis was in trouble and she was alone </s>
<s> somewhere birds were sweetly calling were answered </s>
<s> her teeth chattered so that she made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible </s>
<s> dave made some sound meant to convey agreement </s>
<s> he inserted the car key in the lock </s>
<s> roberta was violently trembling </s>
<s> the car door crashed shut </s>
<s> the engine throbbed into life </s>
<s> you go </s>
<s> walk </s>
<s> the big car sprang away from the curb like something alive </s>
<s> roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling </s>
<s> his jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard </s>
<s> his small mean eyes regarded marty steadily unblinkingly </s>
<s> his eyes were threaded by little filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into them </s>
<s> as he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey </s>
<s> marty recognized the man </s>
<s> this was acey squire proprietor of the juke joint </s>
<s> squire chewed his gum his jaw moving in a steady rhythm </s>
<s> he looked straight at marty </s>
<s> he did not answer </s>
<s> marty scanned the faces of the others nearest him looked into their staring eyes </s>
<s> he asked keeping his voice casual </s>
<s> he avoided showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him </s>
<s> the seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer </s>
<s> and then a startling thing occurred </s>
<s> it was so utterly unexpected that marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly after it had happened </s>
<s> there was no word spoken no apparent signal given </s>
<s> yet the men all moved at the same instant </s>
<s> they piled into the waiting cars motors roared the cars sped off </s>
<s> the station wagon and the old plymouth headed east toward jarrodsville </s>
<s> in seconds all four cars were out of sight </s>
<s> marty land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm clouds gathered ominously in the sky again </s>
<s> from a great distance thunder growled and broke the silence </s>
<s> land looked back toward the dilapidated house </s>
<s> he thought he saw a pale face at a window </s>
<s> perhaps it was dora may </s>
<s> there were other farmhouses nearby </s>
<s> across the road there was one no more than a hundred yards away </s>
<s> there was another on this side a little further down </s>
<s> there were many more between here and jarrodsville </s>
<s> telephone poles lined the road </s>
<s> they reared tall and mocking </s>
<s> their wires stretched out into infinity </s>
<s> not a single strand of wire reached into the silent houses beside the red-clay road </s>
<s> there was nothing he could do but walk </s>
<s> and jarrodsville was more than three miles away down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire </s>
<s> marty faced east and started walking down the left side of the road </s>
<s> after he had proceeded a few feet he paused and turned up the cuffs of his trousers which were already damp and mud-caked </s>
<s> the viscous mud was ankle-deep and in places great puddles spread across the road and reflected the murky light </s>
<s> as he approached the first farmhouse thunder sounded behind him again closer now and louder like a steadily advancing drum corps </s>
<s> there were several people on the porch of the farmhouse </s>
<s> there was a very old man and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers </s>
<s> for just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help </s>
<s> perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town </s>
<s> then he realized the utter futility of the idea </s>
<s> they were staring at him in the same blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared </s>
<s> even the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious </s>
<s> on his side of the road there were two farm hands well back in a field leaning against a plow </s>
<s> they too stared at him </s>
<s> the drums of thunder were right behind him now </s>
<s> a foolish thought came into his head </s>
<s> he remembered a story he had read as a youth </s>
<s> it concerned an officer who had been disgraced and drummed out </s>
<s> the steady roll of the drums had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded and each man about-faced and turned his back as the officer approached </s>
<s> marty wished these poor farm people would turn their backs </s>
<s> the fencing by the roadside ended </s>
<s> now the dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch too broad to leap over unless you were an olympic star </s>
<s> he was trapped on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car </s>
<s> it was coming toward him </s>
<s> the car was now in sight </s>
<s> it was the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road the station wagon that had been parked at the burch farm </s>
<s> it had headed back toward jarrodsville </s>
<s> that had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road </s>
<s> now acey and his friends were returning to seek him out </s>
<s> the station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of him beside a fenced field </s>
<s> then there was another sound </s>
<s> marty looked helplessly in both directions </s>
<s> it was a narrow road barely wide enough for two cars to pass </s>
<s> he could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage ditch </s>
<s> when the two cars were equidistant from him the station wagon started up again and the ford gathered speed </s>
<s> they bore down on him </s>
<s> there was nothing he could do except jump into the ditch </s>
<s> he jumped and sank to his knees in muddy water </s>
<s> as the two cars roared by there was a high-pitched eerie nerve-shattering sound </s>
<s> marty knew how the union soldiers must have felt at chancellorsville and antietam and gettysburg when the ragged gray ranks charged at them screaming the wild banshee howl they called the rebel yell </s>
<s> for moments he stood in water shivering and gasping for breath </s>
<s> he had turned his ankle slightly and it pained him </s>
<s> the cars with their load of howling men had disappeared in the distance </s>
<s> there had been two more cars parked at the farm a plymouth and a pickup truck </s>
<s> they would be coming for him next bearing down on him from both directions </s>
<s> and then the station wagon and the ford would seek him out again </s>
<s> he would be harassed repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time all the way to jarrodsville </s>
<s> he still had three miles to go </s>
<s> he could not go through the fields </s>
<s> that way was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence </s>
<s> he had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the rail fence the section by the farmhouse </s>
<s> at least he could climb up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again </s>
<s> the admassy place could not be far now </s>
<s> he would go in there climb through the window and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest </s>
<s> there was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected </s>
<s> he did not dare climb back up to the road </s>
<s> he was deep in water but at least they could not reach him there </s>
<s> he splashed on mud sucking at his feet with each step until he reached the end of the drainage ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm </s>
<s> he climbed back to the road and he felt utterly exhausted </s>
<s> he stood panting for a moment </s>
<s> and then he saw something that he had not seen before and panic gripped him again </s>
<s> the fence his only refuge when the metal death came roaring at him was made of rails all right but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed against it </s>
<s> he lurched on down the road despairingly because there was no place else to go </s>
<s> he lost all sense of dignity </s>
<s> you could not stand on dignity when you were soaked and muddied and your life was at stake </s>
<s> probably people were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse too but he did not bother to look </s>
<s> he broke into a dogtrot breathing heavily streaming with sweat </s>
<s> it was his only sanctuary </s>
<s> the fences on both sides of the road bristled with the barbed wire </s>
<s> the fences stretched on endlessly </s>
<s> and then he heard them </s>
<s> and now he saw them </s>
<s> the plymouth was coming at him from the east the pickup truck from the west </s>
<s> they had timed it better this time </s>
<s> they would reach him at almost exactly the same instant </s>
<s> he stopped stone-still </s>
<s> if he backed against the fence one of the cars would brush him as it passed and he would be cruelly lacerated by the wire </s>
<s> he stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there waiting for them a perfect target </s>
<s> the cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to the floor boards </s>
<s> they were coming on at reckless speed for such old vehicles </s>
<s> they thundered at him </s>
<s> he held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible </s>
<s> when the plymouth neared it veered toward him and seemed about to run him down </s>
<s> he forced himself to stay frozen there </s>
<s> if he moved he would be in the path of the other car </s>
<s> he thought the fender of the plymouth brushed his jacket as it went by </s>
<s> in a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by on the other side </s>
<s> the weird insane sound of the rebel yell reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills </s>
<s> he did not leave the middle of the road </s>
<s> he did not try to run </s>
<s> he trudged on his aching eyes focused straight ahead </s>
<s> he was nearing the admassy house </s>
<s> he was going to make it he told himself </s>
<s> and then he heard a car coming from the east and he felt as if he would break down and weep </s>
<s> there was a new sound a sound as piercing as the rebel yell yet different </s>
<s> it was the sound of a siren </s>
<s> now he saw that the approaching car was painted white and he began to wave his arms frantically </s>
<s> the car drew up alongside him and stopped </s>
<s> he staggered into the back seat and lay back fighting for breath </s>
<s> there was someone in front with the sheriff </s>
<s> it was pete holmes the cabdriver </s>
<s> the sheriff was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space </s>
<s> this is redneck country </s>
<s> every man in every one of these houses is a night rider </s>
<s> then he turned the telephone over to rourke and went into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes </s>
<s> rourke was talking on the phone when he came back </s>
<s> shayne looked at his watch </s>
<s> rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung up </s>
<s> rourke hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes </s>
<s> he went to a closet to get a light jacket and took his hat from beside the door </s>
<s> that is maybe not too much of a lady </s>
<s> he opened the door and followed rourke out </s>
<s> as he drove he filled in timothy rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the peralta house and on his own surmises </s>
<s> shayne asked peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign </s>
<s> turn to the left i think for that number you gave me </s>
<s> shayne got in the left-hand lane and cut across the boulevard divider </s>
<s> there was a small neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet palm-lined street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story mansions now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments </s>
<s> shayne drove westward from the boulevard slowly letting rourke crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers </s>
<s> a single automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side </s>
<s> shayne noted idly that it carried miami beach license plates as he approached and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed indicating that it was occupied </s>
<s> instead of pulling into the curb shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left </s>
<s> he went around the corner and parked turning off his lights and motor </s>
<s> his voice was chilling and cold </s>
<s> i was watching for numbers </s>
<s> two men in the front seat </s>
<s> i got a quick look at their faces as we went past </s>
<s> a couple named harris and geely </s>
<s> shayne nodded grimly </s>
<s> on felice perrin </s>
<s> i may be wrong </s>
<s> you drive on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there </s>
<s> make them show their hands </s>
<s> shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out </s>
<s> timothy rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel </s>
<s> shayne chuckled </s>
<s> he crossed the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant </s>
<s> he was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when rourke came in six or eight minutes later </s>
<s> the reporter nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar </s>
<s> harris and geely </s>
<s> take your time with your drink </s>
<s> in exactly three minutes go in that phone booth behind you and call police headquarters </s>
<s> just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell of a fight down the street and they better send a patrol car </s>
<s> then hang up fast and come walking on down to the perrin address </s>
<s> will that pay for a pint i can take with me </s>
<s> the bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill </s>
<s> he turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to shayne </s>
<s> shayne strode out blithely and rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police </s>
<s> outside shayne hesitated when he saw that rourke had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed south </s>
<s> he walked over to the right-hand door opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket </s>
<s> he went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two beach detectives in the front seat </s>
<s> he tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the right-hand side </s>
<s> the big paunchy man named geely was on that side half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door </s>
<s> shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night </s>
<s> shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground and then dived over him through the open door into harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster somewhat impeded by the steering wheel </s>
<s> shayne locked his big hands around harris thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway </s>
<s> he hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp </s>
<s> he got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the top sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men and then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat </s>
<s> they went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling </s>
<s> a row of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names on them </s>
<s> shayne found one marked perrin aj </s>
<s> the stairway on the right was dark but there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top and they went up </s>
<s> there were two front rooms both dark behind their transoms and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake </s>
<s> eight nine steps above him roberts had paused </s>
<s> mickey paused with him waiting no longer impatient trying now to think it out do a little planning </s>
<s> he looked down over the banister at the hotel desk with the telephone and pen set </s>
<s> if i could call in they could check the story while we were on our way </s>
<s> then he heard it like a muffled thud felt a subtle change in air pressure </s>
<s> he glanced up in time to see roberts hurtling down on him from above literally flying through the air his bloody face twisted </s>
<s> mickey tried to flatten against the banister gripped it with one hand but roberts full weight struck him at that moment in the groin </s>
<s> he gasped for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail </s>
<s> he tumbled with roberts helpless and in agony over and over down the steps </s>
<s> by a wrenching effort he managed to hunch and draw in to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head </s>
<s> he was fuzzy in his mind and for a moment helpless on the lobby floor but he was conscious and free of the weight of roberts body </s>
<s> when his vision cleared he saw the taller one scrambling upward reaching </s>
<s> mickey was on his knees when roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand </s>
<s> he felt his empty pocket and knew that roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand </s>
<s> he rose stiffly forcing his knees to lock </s>
<s> the knifelike pain in his groin nearly brought him down again </s>
<s> he made himself back off slowly his eyes wary on roberts who now had no more to lose than he </s>
<s> the pain dulled as he moved and he steadied inside </s>
<s> after a moment he extended one hand the fingers curled </s>
<s> roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps </s>
<s> he held the razor well out to one side </s>
<s> he was invulnerable to attack but he could be handled mickey knew if he could be brought to make the first move </s>
<s> they were eight feet apart when roberts cleared the last step </s>
<s> mickey waited with slack arms </s>
<s> the taunt was lost on roberts </s>
<s> he advanced slowly directly giving no hint of a feint to either side </s>
<s> mickey backed off two steps forcing him to come on again </s>
<s> there was a fixed grin on roberts face made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood </s>
<s> mickey backed off again and roberts hesitated then came along </s>
<s> mickey felt his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door </s>
<s> this was going to be it now any second and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor no matter what even if roberts should feint with a kick to the groin the deadly hand was his exclusive concern </s>
<s> the kick came sudden and vicious but short </s>
<s> it moved in a silver arc toward his throat then veered downward </s>
<s> he hunched his left shoulder into it and slashed at roberts forearm with his own felt the blade slide off his sleeve </s>
<s> before roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face he slammed his right fist into roberts belly </s>
<s> roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly </s>
<s> ducking mickey tripped and fell to one side landing heavily on the wood floor </s>
<s> then roberts was on him gasping for breath and for a couple of seconds mickey lost sight of the blade </s>
<s> he felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs </s>
<s> he got a knee up into roberts belly used both hands and heaved him clear then scrambled to his feet </s>
<s> they were in the center of the lobby now </s>
<s> still clutching the razor roberts came up into a crouch shaking his head </s>
<s> when he charged mickey was ready </s>
<s> he hit roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly then wobbled in mid-air </s>
<s> with his right fist and nearly all his weight behind it he smashed at the bloodstained face </s>
<s> roberts careened backward his back arched fought for balance and failing stumbled against the newel post at the foot of the stairs </s>
<s> the sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate sudden-end sound </s>
<s> he fell on his side across the lowest step rolled over once then lay still </s>
<s> mickey found himself leaning against the desk with stiff hands panting for breath </s>
<s> after a minute he went to roberts looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse </s>
<s> roberts appeared to be dead </s>
<s> if not yet then soon very soon </s>
<s> suddenly it was cold in the lobby </s>
<s> it seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do </s>
<s> actually it was no more than eight or ten minutes and the sum of his reasoning came to this </s>
<s> the local law here would hold me till they check clear back home and maybe more than that </s>
<s> they would have to </s>
<s> by then they could never catch up with the others </s>
<s> he looked at where roberts lay sprawled on the step </s>
<s> mickey was sure now he was dead </s>
<s> one thing he thought nobody knows about it yet </s>
<s> only me </s>
<s> he climbed the stairs went into roberts room found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could </s>
<s> he left a few things </s>
<s> roberts was a wastrel </s>
<s> walking away on impulse he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry </s>
<s> when he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about the room wiping carefully everything he might have touched </s>
<s> it took him nearly an hour </s>
<s> he went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat </s>
<s> he left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby </s>
<s> he set roberts suitcase near the front door went outside and walked back to the garage </s>
<s> he was mildly surprised to find it was snowing </s>
<s> it snowed softly silently an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky </s>
<s> he could feel it on his face and in his hair </s>
<s> he found the key to the jeep got it started and warmed it up for five minutes </s>
<s> then he backed out and swung around to the front drive </s>
<s> he went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor </s>
<s> he put it in his own pocket for safekeeping </s>
<s> he took the suitcase out to the jeep and put it in the front seat </s>
<s> then he went back for roberts </s>
<s> the body was heavier than he had anticipated </s>
<s> he got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the jeep </s>
<s> he drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier </s>
<s> it snowed continuously but quietly evenly </s>
<s> when he reached the dip in the woods he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely discernible </s>
<s> the jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground </s>
<s> he drove in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine </s>
<s> he parked facing it and left the headlights on but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase he found the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the passage </s>
<s> he went back and got the flashlight returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier </s>
<s> he tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it </s>
<s> when the dust settled he went back to the jeep and carefully worked roberts body onto his shoulder </s>
<s> the soft snow was deceitful underfoot </s>
<s> twice he nearly fell </s>
<s> inside the passage he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden </s>
<s> by the time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the dead weight </s>
<s> he stood looking down for a few seconds then backed up two or three paces from the edge </s>
<s> there was too much weight casually to toss it away </s>
<s> he could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out </s>
<s> it would be a bad place to die </s>
<s> it was a bad place for roberts to wind up but roberts had asked for it </s>
<s> it was too late to worry about that </s>
<s> he knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel </s>
<s> it was a relief to get rid of the weight </s>
<s> he was shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down </s>
<s> then he got on his knees and rolled roberts body toward the edge </s>
<s> it hung momentarily on the point of dropping off </s>
<s> he gave it a strong push heard it slide then tumble dryly into the hole </s>
<s> he got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit </s>
<s> the body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor </s>
<s> deep enough he decided </s>
<s> there was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter </s>
<s> the external signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow probably by the next day </s>
<s> by spring it would be a skeleton </s>
<s> he made his way back to the jeep </s>
<s> he had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket </s>
<s> he climbed down went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit </s>
<s> it landed on roberts sprawled right thigh poised precariously then slid off to the ground </s>
<s> he went back once more to the jeep and started the short drive to the hotel </s>
<s> in the garage he checked the jeep for signs of the use he had made of it </s>
<s> there were stains here and there and he cleaned them off using an oiled rag he found on a nail </s>
<s> he wiped the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the jeep </s>
<s> he replaced the flashlight where it had been stowed got into his own car and backed it out of the garage </s>
<s> there were tire marks where it had been but they were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny </s>
<s> liz peabody he thought might spend some time grieving for her lost lover but he doubted that she would launch an investigation </s>
<s> he judged her to be a woman of some pride though not much sense </s>
<s> still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who apparently had run away </s>
<s> he put in a call to cunningham from his hotel room </s>
<s> the maid answered and he decided nancy must be at work </s>
<s> a woman named lisa who tells nobody anything about herself </s>
<s> on the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over lake pontchartrain and along the coast </s>
<s> he checked into a motel and drove downtown </s>
<s> the courthouse was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome </s>
<s> he figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff </s>
<s> a clerk in the outer office took him in to sheriff carruthers a big paunchy man with thick white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office </s>
<s> he explained the background of the case ending with the tenuous clue which had brought him to gulf springs </s>
<s> i think the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms match with the obituaries a little later </s>
<s> mrs calhoun has been society editor here for twenty-five years </s>
<s> he smiled </s>
<s> he stood up </s>
<s> tracking down mrs calhoun was like trying to catch up with paul revere between lexington and concord </s>
<s> it turned out that she also sold real estate cosmetics and hospital insurance </s>
<s> she was a large woman with a frizzled gray poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter </s>
<s> it took a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted </s>
<s> well i do remember one </s>
<s> from baton rouge </s>
<s> married a man named vincent black </s>
<s> i can look it up </s>
<s> he was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred </s>
<s> he stood up and thanked her </s>
<s> she asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye </s>
<s> he hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving </s>
<s> in the basement the sheriff took him to a small dingy office occupied by a tall thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves </s>
<s> mr ferrell is a private detective hirey </s>
<s> carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half </s>
<s> he pulled it open </s>
<s> before we built the new jail we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded </s>
<s> hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners </s>
<s> he walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full of big leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls </s>
<s> a metal table and four chairs stood in the center </s>
<s> hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules </s>
<s> chapter fourteen </s>
<s> in a tour around the stacks he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed clockwise around the room </s>
<s> an old weakness for burrowing in records rose up to tempt him </s>
<s> from reconstruction to moon rockets </s>
<s> but he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones </s>
<s> near it was a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf </s>
<s> he pulled it over climbed up and lifted out the big volume almost losing his balance from the weight of it </s>
<s> he staggered over and dropped it on the table </s>
<s> since mrs calhoun remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring he started to plod through several months </s>
<s> he tried to turn right to the society page in each one but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract him </s>
<s> it told him little more than mrs calhoun had remembered stating that it had been a small modest wedding compared to some of the others </s>
<s> there was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom </s>
<s> the one line on the bride said she was miss lisa carmody from baton rouge </s>
<s> no mention of new orleans </s>
<s> hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for mr black </s>
<s> now for their exodus from gulf springs </s>
<s> this time the search took twice as long cutting down on his extra reading for he had to pick through several columns of one- and two-line social notes in each issue </s>
<s> he glanced at his watch saw it was only seven and decided to indulge his weakness now </s>
<s> in the middle of the stock market crash he heard a slight noise in the outer office </s>
<s> he turned around saw nothing and decided it must be a mouse </s>
<s> something else distracted him yet there was no sound only tomblike silence </s>
<s> then he knew it was not sound but lack of it </s>
<s> the air conditioner was no longer running </s>
<s> he jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing </s>
<s> it clanged shut as he sprang toward it </s>
<s> he pressed his face against the grille </s>
<s> then he heard the outer door closing </s>
<s> he thought it must be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around figuring that hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up </s>
<s> then the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind </s>
<s> whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted </s>
<s> no they could kill him just as easy right now </s>
<s> nobody could hear what was going on in this underground vault </s>
<s> it must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisors office </s>
<s> until now lilac gaylor and lila kingsley had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing </s>
<s> except for those minutes in her room he had lost touch with her as a reality </s>
<s> they kept drifting apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life on a microscope slide </s>
<s> it was awkward very awkward </s>
<s> there would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over </s>
<s> someone reasonably trustworthy </s>
<s> and angie would hear about it </s>
<s> no trouble </s>
<s> dear heaven no thought mr skyros turning away as another man came in </s>
<s> he straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand </s>
<s> the genial smile seemed painted on his face </s>
<s> angie knew too much entirely already </s>
<s> really he had mr skyros at bay </s>
<s> all about that angie knew too </s>
<s> mr skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles </s>
<s> he found money much more interesting </s>
<s> i go over to castro and get fixed up there </s>
<s> angelo gave him an affectionate smile </s>
<s> and all because of domokous </s>
<s> of course there was another factor </s>
<s> angie worth his weight in gold right now but these users they sometimes went down fast </s>
<s> who knew angie might not last long </s>
<s> you see you got to remember we all got schedules like any business </s>
<s> sure </s>
<s> sure </s>
<s> i bring you the cash say five hundred for ten decks </s>
<s> he got out of there in a hurry brushing past another man in the door mopping his brow </s>
<s> it could all be straightened out later </s>
<s> not very much later but when things had settled down a little </s>
<s> after this deal with the bouvardier woman went through </s>
<s> an ace of spades </s>
<s> he was not a superstitious man but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that indeed </s>
<s> katya roslev who would be katharine ross so very soon now rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change </s>
<s> she did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks </s>
<s> funny how seldom they did used to it probably </s>
<s> the kind who came into a cheap store like this </s>
<s> grab snatch i saw that first </s>
<s> this kind of place </s>
<s> never have to </s>
<s> no need say anything at all to the old woman </s>
<s> a better life </s>
<s> escape </s>
<s> katya made up the amount in indifferent silence </s>
<s> she was listening to other voices out of the future </s>
<s> some of those vaguely-imagined new different people </s>
<s> soon very soon now </s>
<s> sixteen </s>
<s> it was going to be another hot day </s>
<s> already the thermometer stood close to ninety </s>
<s> alison was still sound asleep </s>
<s> he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom which tasted peculiarly of face powder </s>
<s> he left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today and drove home </s>
<s> he seemed to remember reading somewhere that abyssinians had large litters and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens </s>
<s> he asked her severely </s>
<s> i wonder if the carters would take one </s>
<s> happened to hear you quarrel about her </s>
<s> but she was talking of emile when she saw the black line of the open door </s>
<s> sarah remembered it clearly </s>
<s> maude went on </s>
<s> she opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you </s>
<s> coffee </s>
<s> maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat </s>
<s> maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take off with a racing start </s>
<s> at the door she turned back her roman nose looking very long now and satiric </s>
<s> ben and lucien have gone after them </s>
<s> i told ben so </s>
<s> she had swished away she had been gone for a long time probably when sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her pour out the coffee so no one would drink it </s>
<s> she was deeply horribly sure that lucien had filled it with opium </s>
<s> she felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time </s>
<s> now wait a minute she told herself think about it </s>
<s> lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee </s>
<s> or someone had taken it during her first day at honotassa </s>
<s> yes she had missed it after her talk with emile after dinner just before emile was shot </s>
<s> rilly or glendora had entered her room while she slept bringing back her washed clothes </s>
<s> it would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor </s>
<s> it was not very reasonable to believe that lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come back to honotassa with a formed plan to murder her </s>
<s> no he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised </s>
<s> her skin crawled lolotte had told maude that she was in the hall and the door was open </s>
<s> sarah had begun to tell lucien of emile she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall </s>
<s> that was not reasonable either </s>
<s> she began to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup </s>
<s> so suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would leave honotassa </s>
<s> that made a certain amount of logic </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> it was merely an attempt to frighten her </s>
<s> she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life </s>
<s> but before she left her room she dug into her big moire bag took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken </s>
<s> rev had known all along </s>
<s> he could conceivably have wished to make sure </s>
<s> rev loved honotassa it was like a part of his breath and body </s>
<s> rev had stressed the need for money </s>
<s> rev would never have tried to give her poison </s>
<s> she thrust the envelope back in the bag </s>
<s> there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen </s>
<s> and in all likelihood by now there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract </s>
<s> sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat </s>
<s> glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice </s>
<s> glendora flapped away </s>
<s> she ate what she could and went out along the covered passageway with the rain dripping from the vines </s>
<s> in the kitchen glendora was despairingly picking chickens </s>
<s> glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers and went with her through the drizzle to the storehouse </s>
<s> sarah found the right key and unlocked the door </s>
<s> it was a long low room like a root cellar for it was banked up with soil and vines had run rampant over that too </s>
<s> it was dark but dry and cool </s>
<s> she doled out what glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried peas eggs cornmeal a little salt </s>
<s> the shelves looked emptier than when miss celie had shown her the storeroom and since the men from the commissary had called </s>
<s> there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with </s>
<s> she took glendora to the smokehouse unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon hanging from the smoke-stained rafters </s>
<s> and the fields were green and growing </s>
<s> maude had said </s>
<s> maude </s>
<s> she sent glendora back to the house her basket and her apron laden </s>
<s> she stood for a moment rain dripping from the trees over her head thinking of maude </s>
<s> maude had the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do </s>
<s> besides there was something hysterical and silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her </s>
<s> maude was neither hysterical nor silly and sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish </s>
<s> yet maude had suggested that sarah return to new york </s>
<s> she started back for the house saw a light in the office opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder </s>
<s> rev george and lolotte were mending shoes </s>
<s> a lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky drizzling day </s>
<s> they were all three bent over a shabby riding boot </s>
<s> george had a tack hammer </s>
<s> rev looked up and saw her </s>
<s> lolotte looked up and stiffened </s>
<s> and what news sarah thought as satirically as maude might have said it </s>
<s> he turned to george and lolotte </s>
<s> george poised with the tack hammer the homely everyday atmosphere all denied an attempt at murder </s>
<s> a rush of panic caught sarah </s>
<s> not now </s>
<s> she thought as warm drizzling rain touched her face </s>
<s> she was no schoolgirl refusing to bear tales </s>
<s> as she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself </s>
<s> if she told anyone of the opium it must be lucien her husband </s>
<s> it might be indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love but it was marriage </s>
<s> it must be lucien </s>
<s> always provided that lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium she thought as coldly and sharply again as maude might have said it </s>
<s> she paused at the kitchen door caught her breath told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen where glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and maude was cleaning lamp chimneys </s>
<s> glendora gave a gulp </s>
<s> the homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency </s>
<s> speak to him again anyway </s>
<s> try talking to some of the fellows he works with friends anyone </s>
<s> try to find out how happy he is with his wife whether he plays around with women </s>
<s> you might try looking into his wife too </s>
<s> conrad interrupted </s>
<s> conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench massaging his right leg </s>
<s> he looked at his watch </s>
<s> it was ten minutes before eleven </s>
<s> he wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession from lionel black </s>
<s> thirty years experience let him know even at this early stage that black was his man </s>
<s> but he still wanted to know why </s>
<s> after leaving conrad gilborn had no destination </s>
<s> he simply walked not noticing where he was not caring </s>
<s> he stopped automatically at the street corners waiting for the traffic lights to change unheeding of other people his coat open and flapping </s>
<s> as he walked he tried to think </s>
<s> of kitti </s>
<s> of himself </s>
<s> mainly of what conrad had tried to make him believe </s>
<s> there was nothing coherent about his thinking </s>
<s> it was a succession of picture-images passing through his mind the same ones different ones in no apparent sequence in no logical succession </s>
<s> the enormity of what conrad had told him made it impossible for gilborn to accept with any degree of realism the actuality of it </s>
<s> emotionally they penetrated him not at all </s>
<s> whoever he was and your wife were intimate </s>
<s> he knew conrad had told him the truth </s>
<s> it was so </s>
<s> she was the sun he the closest planet orbiting around her the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed </s>
<s> for fifty-five years he had lived progressing towards a no-goal eating working breathing without plan without reason </s>
<s> kitti had come along to justify everything </s>
<s> she was his goal she was his reason </s>
<s> he had lived all his life waiting for her </s>
<s> not once in the time that he had known her had he ever considered the possibility not once not for one one-thousandth of a second of her infidelity </s>
<s> he could not consider it now </s>
<s> not really </s>
<s> and so he walked aimless again </s>
<s> the walk ended inevitably right in front of his hotel building </s>
<s> the doorman began to nod his head automatically then remembered who gilborn was what had happened to him the night before </s>
<s> he looked at gilborn with undisguised curiosity </s>
<s> gilborn passed by him without seeing him </s>
<s> he crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts </s>
<s> in the apartment itself all was still </s>
<s> the police were no longer there </s>
<s> there was no evidence that anything was different than it had been </s>
<s> without taking off his coat he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door </s>
<s> at last sitting there in the familiar surroundings the truth began to sink in </s>
<s> he felt no anger towards kitti no sense that she had betrayed him </s>
<s> she was all he had everything he had everything he wanted </s>
<s> someone had taken her away from him </s>
<s> where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger there is a right-hand one he remembered from his school days </s>
<s> where there is a victim there is a killer </s>
<s> whoever he was and your wife were intimate </s>
<s> he rose from the chair took off his coat </s>
<s> quickly he went into the bedroom </s>
<s> the bed still showed signs of where kitti had lain </s>
<s> gilborn stood there for a long time </s>
<s> he looked at the bed unblinkingly </s>
<s> the bed was empty now </s>
<s> kitti would lie in it no more </s>
<s> he would lie in it no more </s>
<s> for thirty minutes stanley gilborn stood there </s>
<s> at the end of the half-hour racking his brains thinking over and over again of kitti her friends her past he left the bedroom </s>
<s> he could think of no answer </s>
<s> gilborn put on his coat again </s>
<s> before leaving he took one last lingering look at the apartment </s>
<s> he knew he would never see it again </s>
<s> in the street walking as quickly as he could stanley gilborn was a lone figure </s>
<s> if anyone had asked her she would have described herself only as nervous and worried </s>
<s> the figures on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter </s>
<s> she wondered whether stanley would call </s>
<s> she wanted to be with him to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed </s>
<s> she had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out </s>
<s> and now she was feeling sick both from concern about stanley and hunger </s>
<s> men she reflected even men like stanley are unpredictable </s>
<s> stanley really was quite predictable </s>
<s> that was one of the things she liked about stanley </s>
<s> the dentist last night for instance </s>
<s> dinner and the movies had been fine </s>
<s> he had taken her upstairs to say good night </s>
<s> she had invited him in for coffee </s>
<s> it was in the kitchen as she was watching the kettle waiting for the water to boil that he had grabbed for her </s>
<s> without warning without giving her a chance to prepare for it </s>
<s> when he left she knew she would never see him again </s>
<s> she could always predict what stanley was going to do ever since she first met him </s>
<s> except for that one morning </s>
<s> the morning he walked in to announce to her blushing that he was married </s>
<s> she thought she was going to die </s>
<s> she had assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him </s>
<s> she thought it was sometime during the second week she worked for stanley </s>
<s> it was nothing that he said or did but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him looking forward to his eventual proposal </s>
<s> she was thirty-one years old then </s>
<s> for blanche it was only a matter of time before stanley would propose </s>
<s> it was to be expected that stanley would be shy slow in taking such a momentous step </s>
<s> stanley went along in life she knew convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman </s>
<s> as a result he never looked for it </s>
<s> but one day she expected he would somehow discover without her having to tell him that there was such a woman in the world </s>
<s> a woman who was willing to give him love faith and anything else a woman could give a husband </s>
<s> indeed there was a woman who unasked had already given him love </s>
<s> unquestionably blanche loved stanley </s>
<s> and then unexpectedly stanley made his announcement </s>
<s> on that first day blanche literally thought she was going to die or at the very least go out of her mind </s>
<s> kitti was thirty years younger than stanley taller than stanley prettier than stanley had any right to hope for much less expect </s>
<s> kitti could have married a score of men </s>
<s> there was no reason for her to marry someone like stanley gilborn there was no need for her to marry stanley </s>
<s> stanley had filled out the return and because when he was finished it was close to the lunch hour he had politely asked kitti to join him never expecting her to accept </s>
<s> stanley had gone out saying he would be back in an hour </s>
<s> it was too unprecedented </s>
<s> then six weeks after the day kitti first came into the office stanley announced he and kitti were married </s>
<s> somehow blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations </s>
<s> while they were away blanche came into the office every morning running things as she had always run them for stanley going through the week in a dazed stupor getting things done automatically out of habit </s>
<s> for exactly one week she was able to continue in this manner </s>
<s> two hours of watching his serenely happy face listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled figures and blanche had to leave </s>
<s> she stayed away for ten days </s>
<s> those ten days were like no others that blanche had known </s>
<s> mostly she stayed in bed </s>
<s> she refused to have a doctor insisting there was nothing a doctor could do for her </s>
<s> he demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack </s>
<s> to make it clearer he shifted to acting out but with no change of manner the killing of rose mallory </s>
<s> in the same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that </s>
<s> he was moving like a ballet dancer playing for laughs </s>
<s> felix was the exception </s>
<s> he had retained his hat and his horn and whatever fun might still be going he was ready to join it </s>
<s> that incidentally might give you some idea of what felix was like </s>
<s> the meat wagon therefore was not out in front of the house any more but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings </s>
<s> there was furthermore the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance </s>
<s> defining sobriety in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not yet eliminated from the system you are sober </s>
<s> you have your paper horn clutched in your big craggy fist and for your entrance you have planned a noisy colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants </s>
<s> you find your house a focus of public and police attention </s>
<s> maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness </s>
<s> you shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door </s>
<s> instead of answering you he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs </s>
<s> then he turns back to you </s>
<s> we were not however prepared for anything like the apparition that confronted us as felix came up the stairs </s>
<s> he of course must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him but nonetheless i did find his reaction startling </s>
<s> he came bounding up the stairs and joined the dance </s>
<s> he adjusted the hat lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a flute and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to cavort with him </s>
<s> our man stopped dead and glowered at felix </s>
<s> felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house </s>
<s> this was a bull of a man </s>
<s> he was big-chested big-shouldered and heavy-armed </s>
<s> his face was ruddy and heavy and unlined and when he laughed he showed his teeth which were big and white and strong and unquestionably home-grown </s>
<s> his hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck </s>
<s> he had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short </s>
<s> it was almost as white as his teeth </s>
<s> for a man of his mass he was curiously short </s>
<s> a man with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five </s>
<s> for felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement </s>
<s> the man was just this side of being a freak </s>
<s> we waited till he had finished laughing and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him </s>
<s> dark gray sports jacket lighter gray slacks pink flannel shirt black silk necktie </s>
<s> his eyes were clear </s>
<s> he was freshly shaved and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts of his laughter </s>
<s> not even a whiff </s>
<s> eventually he subsided </s>
<s> gibby said </s>
<s> we are assistant district attorneys </s>
<s> this gentleman is a police officer </s>
<s> he is a fingerprint specialist </s>
<s> the happy one could never have looked happier </s>
<s> this was more than joy </s>
<s> it was ecstasy </s>
<s> come right along </s>
<s> he was prancing along the hall heading for the next flight of stairs </s>
<s> gibby called him back </s>
<s> felix asked </s>
<s> gibby asked not bothering to whisper </s>
<s> obligingly gibby lowered his voice </s>
<s> he repeated </s>
<s> edmund but not for years </s>
<s> having volunteered that he was a man of about sixty he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less credible </s>
<s> this was a broth of a boy our felix and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit </s>
<s> we followed him up the stairs </s>
<s> the cops would gather up connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting </s>
<s> also if we had excluded the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood </s>
<s> the killer if in our present group would certainly be interested in knowing that much and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it was i could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation there might always be some way </s>
<s> felix took us into his studio </s>
<s> it was that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope </s>
<s> at each angle of its pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades </s>
<s> when felix first opened the door on it all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night </s>
<s> he quickly fixed that rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others </s>
<s> he flew about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience </s>
<s> none of his movements was tentative </s>
<s> there was no process of trial and error </s>
<s> starting with the room completely blacked out as it was when we came in he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting even so much as a crack of glare </s>
<s> expecting something more-than-average wacky i was surprised by what we found </s>
<s> there was no display of either works in progress or of finished work </s>
<s> here and there on work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped over it </s>
<s> these shapes might have been mad but there was no telling </s>
<s> they were all completely shrouded </s>
<s> the equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition </s>
<s> there were tools about but they were neatly kept </s>
<s> there was no confusion and no litter </s>
<s> supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins </s>
<s> andy did not see the newspapers the next day </s>
<s> memory flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach </s>
<s> outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day </s>
<s> presumably the same sun was shining upon little drew also and those who had kidnapped him </s>
<s> it was still a very big world despite all the modern cant to the contrary </s>
<s> hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door </s>
<s> nothing new </s>
<s> hub picked up the telephone </s>
<s> hub considered </s>
<s> hub shook his head so andy told him not to bother </s>
<s> the only reason for contacting lissa was to comfort or to be comforted </s>
<s> he could not manage the former or expect the latter </s>
<s> they had nothing to give to each other </s>
<s> the omission might look peculiar to outsiders but andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances </s>
<s> he had little time to himself anyway </s>
<s> as the afternoon sped toward evening the suite saw a steady procession of paxton aides pass in and out each with his own special problem </s>
<s> thornburg arrived with the writers </s>
<s> they had spent the morning revising the act eliminating all the gay songs patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations </s>
<s> what remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified as befitting the tragic circumstances </s>
<s> he asked if there was anything he could do </s>
<s> andy invented a job to keep him busy sending him ahead to el dorado to supervise last minute arrangements </s>
<s> but from rocco vecchio they heard nothing </s>
<s> at last it was time to depart </s>
<s> they succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub </s>
<s> el dorado was surrounded by a mob </s>
<s> they overflowed the parking lot making progress by automobile difficult </s>
<s> long before he reached the protection of the stage door andy was recognized </s>
<s> word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire </s>
<s> they surged around him fingers pointing eyes prying </s>
<s> they had come not to admire but to observe </s>
<s> backstage was tomblike by contrast </s>
<s> it was signed by everyone in the troupe </s>
<s> he instructed shirl winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board </s>
<s> bake was waiting to report that lou duvol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently </s>
<s> andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment </s>
<s> bake himself looked better </s>
<s> any kind of job was better than brooding </s>
<s> a short time later lieutenant bonner stomped into the dressing room </s>
<s> andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying </s>
<s> motion picture cameras had been installed to film the audience the reservation list was being checked out name by name and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead </s>
<s> however it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside even if bonner had manpower available for the purpose </s>
<s> andy sighed </s>
<s> andy crumbled the script in his fist </s>
<s> but bonner departed still full of ill will </s>
<s> he had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination </s>
<s> he had to cling to routine tested procedures </s>
<s> to act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness </s>
<s> but admit or not bonner was helpless </s>
<s> the crime showed too much planning the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist </s>
<s> he stalled for a half-hour longer hoping to hear something from vecchio about the ransom money </s>
<s> bake and shirl winter on separate telephones could not reach him at any conceivable location in los angeles nor could they secure any clear-cut information regarding his efforts </s>
<s> bake cursed </s>
<s> bake asked </s>
<s> we got a bunch of sippers out there tonight </s>
<s> hub you stick by the stage door </s>
<s> following him </s>
<s> it was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different as if he really needed it </s>
<s> they were right </s>
<s> the act cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone </s>
<s> the result had nothing of the polish pace or cohesion of the previous night </s>
<s> but this was no ordinary show and andy knew it </s>
<s> whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it </s>
<s> the audience had come not to be entertained but to judge </s>
<s> twenty-four hours had changed him from a performer to a freak </s>
<s> within this framework what followed was strained even macabre </s>
<s> eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy </s>
<s> the effect was as depressing as a gravestone the applause irresolute and short-lived </s>
<s> yet andy plowed ahead mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning and gradually his listeners warmed to him </s>
<s> their clapping grew more fervent </s>
<s> the evening was still not beyond salvaging not as a show but for him as a person </s>
<s> the worst was yet to come </s>
<s> as andy reached the finale of his act a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings </s>
<s> vecchio was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held </s>
<s> andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief </s>
<s> he waved at fox to cut off the finale introduction </s>
<s> the music died away discordantly </s>
<s> he drew a deep breath </s>
<s> he sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience </s>
<s> nor could he blame them </s>
<s> this particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency </s>
<s> having no choice he plunged into it anyway holding onto the microphone for support </s>
<s> his voice shook </s>
<s> for the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover up by humming the rest </s>
<s> he wondered if the audience would let him finish </s>
<s> they did </s>
<s> though contemptuous they were still polite </s>
<s> but when he was finally through their scorn was made apparent </s>
<s> someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped </s>
<s> otherwise the silence was complete </s>
<s> as the lights came up andy could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward the exit </s>
<s> he stumbled off-stage </s>
<s> hub was there to support him </s>
<s> thornburg patted his arm </s>
<s> the words were hollow </s>
<s> thornburg knew better than any of them that a public image was as fragile as humpty dumpty </s>
<s> vecchio shouldered in </s>
<s> god knows how but i got it </s>
<s> andy nodded dully </s>
<s> he clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room </s>
<s> the usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent </s>
<s> the place had the air of a morgue </s>
<s> andy had no desire to linger himself but hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them </s>
<s> his son watched until he got as far as the hall almost out of sight then hurried after </s>
<s> he caught up with the old man in the living room </s>
<s> old man arthur had put down the suitcase to open the front door </s>
<s> the old man gave the room a stare in leaving </s>
<s> under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory </s>
<s> rossi and ferguson have been across the street talking to the kid </s>
<s> he limps and the man who hit you and took the cane he limped </s>
<s> his father looked him over closely </s>
<s> young mrs arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits </s>
<s> the old man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight </s>
<s> mrs holden turned from the window draperies </s>
<s> she walked restlessly across the room then back to the windows </s>
<s> she stood frowning and chewing her lip </s>
<s> she was wearing a brown cotton dress cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look slimmer a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below </s>
<s> she smoothed the skirt sat down then stood up and went back to the windows </s>
<s> i want you here </s>
<s> his voice grew high and trembling </s>
<s> deliberately she ignored the yelp </s>
<s> i guess he wants to ask you some questions </s>
<s> i stalled him off </s>
<s> she slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped away </s>
<s> her eyes were bright with anticipation </s>
<s> in his office mr holden replaced the phone slowly </s>
<s> he rose from his chair </s>
<s> he had to cough then </s>
<s> he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face </s>
<s> he got his hat out of the closet </s>
<s> he got into the car </s>
<s> putting the key into the switch pressing the accelerator with his foot putting the car into reverse seemed vast endeavors almost beyond the ability of his shaking body </s>
<s> once out in the street the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken </s>
<s> when he turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then rose toward home he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear them of tears </s>
<s> her motives were too blatant </s>
<s> she wanted him to get into trouble </s>
<s> she wanted the police to notice him suspect him </s>
<s> she was going to keep on scheming poking prodding suggesting and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions </s>
<s> and he knew in that moment with a cold sinking of despair a dying of old hopes that mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors </s>
<s> nothing bald open </s>
<s> but enough </s>
<s> though his inner thoughts cringed at it he forced himself to think back recreating the scene in which mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child </s>
<s> there had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions </s>
<s> a second scene flashed before his mind the interior of the garage at the new house and the young bartlett girl turning startled to meet him the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as mae had clicked on the light </s>
<s> and when he came to examine the scene there was a certain staginess to it it had the smell of planning and a swift suspicion darted into his mind </s>
<s> too monstrous of course </s>
<s> it was just that little accidents played into her hands </s>
<s> like this murder </s>
<s> he leaned on the wheel clutching it staring into the sunlight and tried to bring order into his thoughts </s>
<s> he felt light-headed and sick </s>
<s> there was no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare </s>
<s> mae was his wife </s>
<s> she was married to him for better or for worse </s>
<s> but she was </s>
<s> she was </s>
<s> even as the conviction of truth roared through him shattering his last hope of safety he was reaching to release the hand brake to head up the road for home doing her bidding </s>
<s> he drove and the road wobbled familiar scenes crept past on either side </s>
<s> he came to a stretch of old orange groves the trees dead some of them uprooted and then there was an outlying shopping area and tract houses </s>
<s> he had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide </s>
<s> there was really no place to go finally except home to mae </s>
<s> at the gate he slowed looking around </s>
<s> cooper was beside his car on the curb at the right just standing there morosely </s>
<s> behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man arthur </s>
<s> he was straight something angry in his attitude as if he might be waiting to report something </s>
<s> holden stepped on the gas </s>
<s> a new idea drifted in from nowhere </s>
<s> he could go to the police </s>
<s> he could throw himself on the mercy of the police department </s>
<s> he was sure of this </s>
<s> at that moment holden almost slammed on the brakes to go back to cooper and ask if ferguson was about </s>
<s> it would be such a relief </s>
<s> hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension </s>
<s> good-bye </s>
<s> holden waved a hand at the empty street </s>
<s> glad to see you go </s>
<s> he drove into the paved space before the garage and got out slamming the car door </s>
<s> he looked up and down the street </s>
<s> he went to the front door and opened it and looked in </s>
<s> mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen </s>
<s> she had a cup of something steaming coffee perhaps in one hand a fresh piece of toast in the other </s>
<s> she stood there watching holden come in and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge chomp of her white teeth </s>
<s> you used them that time you painted the porch at our other house </s>
<s> she had caught him off guard no preparation nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster </s>
<s> wait a minute </s>
<s> or even yesterday </s>
<s> you used to paint in them and then you just took them for rags </s>
<s> she stood sipping and chewing and watching </s>
<s> put down the cup of coffee </s>
<s> she shook her head </s>
<s> she took another bite of toast </s>
<s> holden noticed almost absently how she chewed how the whole side of her cheek moved a slab of fat that extended down into her neck </s>
<s> his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass-like liable to break like an icicle at any moment </s>
<s> when he had finished with that he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else most probably a busboy </s>
<s> men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the hotel dumont and blew it off again and did the same in a tiny almost airless room in a tenement in the west forties </s>
<s> and men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms sucking dust up once more </s>
<s> men from the third detective district eighteenth precinct had the longest the most tedious job </s>
<s> at the hotel dumont there had at the time in issue been twenty-three overnighters counting couples as singular </s>
<s> these included as one mr and mrs anthony payne who had checked in a little after noon the day before and had not checked out together </s>
<s> but gardner willings was not included </s>
<s> he had been at the dumont for almost a week </s>
<s> there was of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel </s>
<s> with names and addresses listed verification came next </s>
<s> it would take time </s>
<s> it would almost inevitably trouble some water </s>
<s> the hotel king arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems </s>
<s> the king arthur was less expensive than the dumont </s>
<s> the king arthur had fifty-four overnighters again counting rooms rather than people </s>
<s> check the overnighters out </s>
<s> it was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel </s>
<s> there were other roofs less convenient but not impossible </s>
<s> it is dull business detecting and hard on feet </s>
<s> there was of course no hope it really would be that simple </s>
<s> the sniper whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent would hardly have walked to his vantage point with rifle over shoulder whistling a marching tune </s>
<s> shrugs met that from room clerks from bellhops </s>
<s> but nothing it appeared long enough to attract attention </s>
<s> none noted at the dumont </s>
<s> several at the king arthur </s>
<s> a combo was staying there </s>
<s> and had been for a week </s>
<s> shrugs met that </s>
<s> the lab to check </s>
<s> the lab sorry </s>
<s> no oil </s>
<s> well a man had tried at the king arthur to register with an ocelot </s>
<s> at the dumont a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair </s>
<s> at the king arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches </s>
<s> there had also been a man who must have had st vitus or something because he kept jerking his head </s>
<s> as reports dribbled in william weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head </s>
<s> mullins came in </s>
<s> there was no sign of mrs lauren payne at her house on nod road ridgefield connecticut </s>
<s> the house was modern large on five acres </s>
<s> must have cost plenty </s>
<s> the state cops would check from time to time </s>
<s> pass word when there was word to pass </s>

<s> the norths </s>
<s> livingston birdwood producer of uprising </s>

<s> take gardner willings </s>
<s> he had left after the scuffle </s>
<s> had been seen to leave </s>
<s> he would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey </s>
<s> willings would ambush certainly </s>
<s> willings undoubtedly had </s>
<s> willings was presumably a better than average shot </s>
<s> because if for no other reason willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger tougher than anything else that went on two legs </s>
<s> ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves as any man may against a tiger </s>
<s> to be checked out further </s>
<s> no motive is a part of fact </s>
<s> nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction </s>
<s> grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind </s>
<s> faith constable had accomplished much in a quarter of a century </s>
<s> bill shook his head </s>
<s> also he thought i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun </s>
<s> she had left the party early pleading a headache </s>
<s> no lack of opportunity presuming she had a gun </s>
<s> she might conceivably have brought one in in a large-enough suitcase </s>
<s> heaven knew it happened and hell knew it too </s>

<s> she did not move in primitive circles </s>

<s> it occurred to bill weigand that he was on a hunch basis eliminating a good many </s>

<s> he also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities </s>
<s> opportunity was obvious </s>
<s> motive </s>
<s> here too the cause to hate lay well back in the years </s>
<s> but bitterness had more cause to remain even increasingly to corrode </s>
<s> with the boy particularly </s>
<s> bill picked up the telephone </s>
<s> got mullins </s>
<s> mullins would do </s>
<s> a man named lars simon playwright-director had expressed a wish that anthony payne drop dead </s>
<s> he would say of course that he had not really had any such wish </s>
<s> that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say lightly meaning nothing </s>
<s> which probably would turn out to be true </s>
<s> which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say </s>
<s> he might deny the latter </s>
<s> would certainly deny any connection between the two things or any connection of either with murder </s>
<s> he would have to be given the opportunity </s>
<s> it was evident that mullins was the man to go </s>
<s> it was evident that a captain should remain at his desk directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat </s>

<s> shadow looked surprised wailed and trotted after her </s>
<s> it was not whatever tale was told by tails </s>
<s> martha presumably would cope </s>
<s> she might be firm </s>
<s> it was most unlikely that she would be firm </s>
<s> they want to be fat cats pam thought and lighted a cigarette and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together </s>
<s> after a time it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble </s>
<s> a vague feeling that anthony payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was in any event reprehensible </s>
<s> that was more like a thought but not a great deal more </s>
<s> pam found she had no answers </s>
<s> had only a hope </s>
<s> some people have luck and some have no luck and that whatever people who prefer order say is the size of it </s>
<s> the telephone rang </s>
<s> pam realized to her surprise that she had been almost dozing </s>
<s> i ought to remember </s>
<s> you do remember </s>
<s> the voice had music in it </s>
<s> even with words coming too fast they came on the music of the voice </s>
<s> not unless they have to </s>
<s> she was interrupted </s>
<s> and it makes a very poor red herring for an inside job </s>
<s> the telephone interrupted him </s>
<s> he hung up </s>
<s> pauling looked at his notes </s>
<s> particles of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils </s>
<s> scrapings from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities </s>
<s> no other cause of death apparent </s>
<s> trachea clear of mucus and foreign objects </s>
<s> brain examined for thrombosis clot or hemorrhage </s>
<s> he paused </s>
<s> oh the time of death </s>
<s> pauling paused again </s>
<s> they discussed this possibility </s>
<s> he had to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to johnston came to light </s>
<s> arthur williams had to be located they agreed </s>
<s> he might have been in collusion with johnston on the fraud </s>
<s> the police chief shook his head over it </s>
<s> if arthur williams was involved in the fraud or the murder then he too had another identity </s>
<s> no one the medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him than about johnston </s>
<s> pauling looked doubtful </s>
<s> madden explained that he was thinking of an application sent directly to mrs meeker </s>
<s> mr hohlbein was out for the day but mr garth would be free at one-thirty </s>
<s> he inferred that hohlbein and garth were high-priced lawyers </s>
<s> he had lunch with pauling </s>
<s> he disliked garth on sight conservative clothes and haircut smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties handclasp too consciously quick and firm </s>
<s> youngish man on the make madden labeled him and was ready to guess that in a correct not too pushing fashion the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions </s>
<s> that mrs garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer </s>
<s> that there were three children two boys and a girl </s>
<s> and finally that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding day </s>
<s> madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this but also knew that he would go right on disliking garth </s>
<s> garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate johnston affair which would not he said more than once have ever come about if mrs meeker had only seen fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it </s>
<s> madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement </s>
<s> garth brought one out </s>
<s> her estate had grown considerably </s>
<s> she wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most </s>
<s> particularly the scholarship fund </s>
<s> garth hesitated </s>
<s> the inspector nodded doubting this </s>
<s> it would have been hohlbein who handled her affairs </s>
<s> madden settled back to read the will </s>
<s> he skimmed over the millions that went to meeker park medfield hospital the civic center the public health nursing association the library and so on pausing when he came to the scholarship fund </s>
<s> a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden reflected </s>
<s> tenure too </s>
<s> very nice for him </s>
<s> he went on to personal bequests a list of names largely unknown to him </s>
<s> to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars </s>
<s> to the pecks ten thousand each </s>
<s> too bad madden thought </s>
<s> joan sheldon had earned the larger bequest </s>
<s> mr hohlbein was left twenty thousand garth ten </s>
<s> there were no other names madden recognized </s>
<s> mrs meeker had spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers </s>
<s> madden took up this point with garth who shrugged it off </s>
<s> madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund </s>
<s> there was an annual audit garth informed him </s>
<s> no discrepancies or shortages had ever been found </s>
<s> brian thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator </s>
<s> his salary had reached the ten thousand mark </s>
<s> his expenses ran another four or five thousand </s>
<s> he would offer no theory to account for her murder </s>
<s> the whole thing his manner conveyed was so far outside the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug </s>
<s> no doubt mrs meeker had snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing </s>
<s> ten-thousand-dollar bequest </s>
<s> at first glance not much of a motive for a man of his standing </s>
<s> the inspector knew as he left that this was wishful thinking </s>
<s> brian thayer had a downtown address </s>
<s> he lived in an apartment house not over three or four years old a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on the fringe of the business district </s>
<s> he occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor using the second bedroom as his office </s>
<s> airy and bright the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture rugs and draperies </s>
<s> done by a professional decorator madden thought and somehow as impersonal as unremarkable as its occupant </s>
<s> in dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month </s>
<s> in medfield perhaps twenty-five less not all of it paid by thayer who could charge off one room on his expense account </s>
<s> he took madden into the room he used as an office </s>
<s> it contained a desk files a typewriter on a stand and two big leather armchairs </s>
<s> a newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them </s>
<s> thayer folded it up and offered a drink </s>
<s> the inspector declined </s>
<s> to begin the interview he asked if thayer with more time to think it over could add to what he had said the other day about johnston </s>
<s> thayer shook his head </s>
<s> that and her death </s>
<s> his rage had built up as he made his way here from the second floor helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed </s>
<s> i want the captain in charge </s>
<s> a couple of sobs escaped him followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state </s>
<s> griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes </s>
<s> he peered closely at hoag in the gathering darkness </s>
<s> he stared at hoag drunkenly </s>
<s> griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it </s>
<s> he nodded triumphantly </s>
<s> hoag looked terrified </s>
<s> hoag grabbed him by the shoulders </s>
<s> he bit out the words </s>
<s> griffith raised placating hands </s>
<s> i was just going </s>
<s> he turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back </s>
<s> he took several large swallows recollected that docherty had gone up another flight and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him </s>
<s> the way hoag was no telling what he might say or do </s>
<s> he finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing </s>
<s> at the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> he spotted docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him </s>
<s> they walked toward each other </s>
<s> griffith looked half-crocked to the captain </s>
<s> it would be just like him </s>
<s> not possible he thought </s>
<s> the prime minister knew who his enemy was here </s>
<s> docherty was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry truck </s>
<s> still this had to be checked out </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> troubled he continued along the corridor poking his head into the next office for a careful look around </s>
<s> but hoag had not stayed on the front steps when griffith disappeared into the building </s>
<s> if mahzeer was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street </s>
<s> he would have to do something on his own </s>
<s> the door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs </s>
<s> in the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps </s>
<s> these were the early departures </s>
<s> in half an hour the reception would be over </s>
<s> if mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes </s>
<s> hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building </s>
<s> wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories </s>
<s> on the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests </s>
<s> the scene looked like a christmas card </s>
<s> on the third floor one of the two windows was lighted </s>
<s> it was framed in maroon drapes and no faces were visible </s>
<s> they would be going over papers mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting </s>
<s> in a minute or five minutes the business would be done </s>
<s> mahzeer would stand up the prime minister would follow </s>
<s> the single shot would come </s>
<s> hoag would carry its sound to his grave </s>
<s> mahzeer of course would be desolate </s>
<s> hoag turned </s>
<s> narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf </s>
<s> most of them could be eliminated </s>
<s> the legation was generously set back from the building line </s>
<s> if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere </s>
<s> he ran his eye along the roof copings </s>
<s> almost at once a figure bulked up </s>
<s> but dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman </s>
<s> hoag crossed the narrow street squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk </s>
<s> if only the latter were true </s>
<s> two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted </s>
<s> that left three possibly four one looking much like the next </s>
<s> he climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule </s>
<s> he quickly closed it again </s>
<s> he had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments but this one from a glance at the hall furnishings was obviously still a functioning town house and its owners were in residence </s>
<s> that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance </s>
<s> on one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes </s>
<s> there were six apartments </s>
<s> the names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him </s>
<s> he peered in the boxes themselves </s>
<s> all were empty except one and that one was jammed with letters and magazines </s>
<s> muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes </s>
<s> he opened the inner door </s>
<s> he paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead </s>
<s> fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open </s>
<s> it had been shut again but the lock was broken </s>
<s> he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch </s>
<s> he had thought no further than finding muller </s>
<s> he could not break in on an armed man </s>
<s> he would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop </s>
<s> his thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door </s>
<s> hoag pushed open the door at the far end of the long dark room muller was faintly silhouetted against the window the rifle still raised </s>
<s> he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill </s>
<s> hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch evil flourishes in the dark </s>
<s> his face wore a look of outrage </s>
<s> a shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain </s>
<s> a following volley of shots shattered glass ripped the ceiling and sent him lurching heavily from the table </s>

<s> gun went to the connecting door which was open and stood at attention while orville torrence killpath in full uniform finished combing his hair </s>
<s> leave me alone gun thought </s>
<s> fight with sam schaeffer fight with the whole damned bureau </s>
<s> but leave me alone </s>
<s> if you just leave me to hell alone lieutenant </s>
<s> killpath peered through half-closed lids at his reflection thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced </s>
<s> gun waited for killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window </s>
<s> he sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel though it was obvious to gun that killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair </s>
<s> the desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room including wooden file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons </s>
<s> killpath pulled one thin leg up clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut </s>
<s> it was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of killpath defying his ulcer </s>
<s> he put his chin on his kneecap stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block and stared wordlessly at his sergeant </s>
<s> gun waited </s>
<s> he rocked back in the chair knee locked against stomach his beady eyes fixed on matson </s>
<s> he was silent again possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom </s>
<s> roll was being called </s>
<s> gun cleared his throat </s>
<s> then killpath smiled </s>
<s> gun knew that nothing but aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time </s>
<s> he smiled thinly savoring his joke </s>
<s> killpath leaned forward </s>
<s> his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again frowning now </s>
<s> gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool </s>
<s> but stupidity was no consolation when it had rank </s>
<s> he stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk </s>
<s> he took up a white sheet of paper dark with single-spaced data </s>
<s> a car pulled into the driveway outside the window </s>
<s> killpath licked his lips </s>
<s> gun held his breath a moment pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat </s>
<s> gun stiffened his hands balling into fists at his sides </s>
<s> he clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling out </s>
<s> an argument with orville torrence killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range </s>
<s> killpath leaned forward again rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee </s>
<s> he stood up cocked his head and eyed gun coldly </s>
<s> now as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office he nodded and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out </s>
<s> if the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night killpath would just have to go out and drag gun back by the heels once an hour </s>

<s> then </s>
<s> sol phillips had purchased the alliance furniture mart seventeen years ago </s>
<s> it was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will and the name was written in gold in foot-high letters across each of the two display windows </s>
<s> on the right window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was gonzalez prop and under that se habla espanol </s>
<s> mr phillips took a razor to gonzalez prop but left the promise that spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that spanish clientele would be welcome </s>
<s> language was no problem anyway </s>
<s> mr phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of mission street </s>
<s> he shrugged </s>
<s> casey made some comment but his mind was busy as he considered the man </s>
<s> his name was george needham and he too had come from a good family </s>
<s> he was perhaps thirty-two nicely set up with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave </s>
<s> an only child he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke </s>
<s> since then he had worked at this and that though some said his main interest was gambling </s>
<s> for he had understood that betty had been engaged to a boy named barry jenkins </s>
<s> she had grown up with young jenkins and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice </s>
<s> and so still wondering and a little perplexed he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding </s>
<s> she glanced at her companion fondly </s>
<s> casey kept his smile fixed but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about needham who was eight or ten years older than the girl </s>
<s> none of this showed in his face and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand </s>
<s> he made a point of frowning of acting out the part of the fond father-confessor </s>
<s> she made a face at him and then she laughed </s>
<s> casey watched them go still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check </s>
<s> as he went out he told freddie the dinner was perfect and when he got his hat and coat from nancy parks and put a fifty-cent piece in the slot he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry </s>
<s> a taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment </s>
<s> in fact he did not think about jerry burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him </s>
<s> only then when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty did he remember his earlier problem </s>
<s> even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top of it </s>
<s> then he was striding across the room his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note </s>
<s> jack </s>
<s> look in the wastebasket </s>
<s> i knew the only way i could beat you was to play possum but it was a good try kid and i appreciate it </s>
<s> the wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan and the instant casey picked it up he knew what had happened </s>
<s> the discarded papers inside were sodden there was a glint of liquid at the bottom and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct </s>
<s> he put the basket down distastefully muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof </s>
<s> for he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself </s>
<s> for another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself </s>
<s> then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious and as the thought expanded the implications jarred him </s>
<s> it no longer mattered that burton had outsmarted him </s>
<s> the important thing was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket </s>
<s> and that gun was empty </s>
<s> even before his mind had rounded out the idea he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver </s>
<s> he considered them with brooding eyes brows bunched as his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find some solution </s>
<s> he put the shells on the table as though he could no longer bear to hold them </s>
<s> there was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room his imagination out of control </s>
<s> he tried to tell himself that maybe burton had sobered up enough to get some sense </s>
<s> maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer whoever he was in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough </s>
<s> he thought of other possibilities none of them satisfactory and finally he began to think to wonder if there was some way he could reach burton </s>
<s> then as he turned toward the telephone it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly </s>
<s> casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head </s>
<s> it still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for frank ackerly </s>
<s> he demanded </s>
<s> casey believed that much </s>
<s> under normal circumstances casey was a little fussy when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken </s>
<s> even so he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly </s>
<s> right now however he was still too worried about jerry burton and the gun that had no bullets and the story burton had told him to care too much about tony calenda </s>
<s> his nerves were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice </s>
<s> i took it </s>
<s> he hung up with a bang annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create </s>
<s> he dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up </s>
<s> he called the bar and grill where he had picked burton up that afternoon </s>
<s> when he was told that no one had seen burton since then he thought of three other places that were possibilities </s>
<s> each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up </s>
<s> by the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down </s>
<s> he had done all he could and that was that </s>
<s> and anyway burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk </s>
<s> he casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible </s>
<s> he should have stayed here and watched burton </s>
<s> so he made a mistake </s>
<s> he kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink </s>
<s> he considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too </s>
<s> finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes </s>
<s> he had just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again </s>
<s> when he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent </s>
<s> if you want a picture get to the corner of adams and clark just as fast as you can </s>
<s> casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision </s>
<s> for over the years he had received many such calls </s>
<s> some of them came from people who identified themselves </s>
<s> some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past </s>
<s> others because they expected some sort of reward for the information </s>
<s> a few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break </s>
<s> only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony and like the police casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time </s>
<s> he was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes and it took him only three more to reach the corner a block from columbus avenue </s>
<s> it was a district of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the brakes </s>
<s> the police car had pulled up behind a small sedan its headlights still on </s>
<s> slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl and watched elaine rapidly spin from one station to another tune in the null then draw in a line on the chart </s>
<s> poet came in raising his eyebrows appreciatively as he saw elaine </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> poet nodded swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward hatch where he picked up the anchor </s>
<s> the rock and roll music coming from the radio station suddenly faded as the boat coasted into the null on the aj </s>
<s> a second later she came behind the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean floor </s>
<s> she cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore </s>
<s> nick watched her somewhat enviously as she efficiently cut the engines and started the auxiliary motor </s>
<s> poet came up from below wearing new bathing trunks </s>
<s> the price tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom and looked at it curiously </s>
<s> nick wondered if elaine had bought them but he said nothing </s>
<s> nobody he suddenly realized was saying anything </s>
<s> it seemed as if they were all under a spell </s>
<s> there should be an excited conversation for somewhere directly below them was a treasure lost for more than four hundred years </s>
<s> but instead of chatter there was a null like on the radio direction finder </s>
<s> once in new york he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane with a single engine </s>
<s> they had all been laughing joking when suddenly the engine had failed </s>
<s> no one had screamed </s>
<s> no one had prayed </s>
<s> all had fallen into a complete silence listening to the wind whistle over the wings </s>
<s> the pilot had been good </s>
<s> there had been tension in the plane during the silent descent </s>
<s> a tension similar to the one now </s>
<s> but in the plane there was a concrete reason for it </s>
<s> now at this moment there should be none unless skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe </s>
<s> yet tension existed </s>
<s> the same taut-nerved relationship as there had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three of them here on the boat </s>
<s> it hung over them like a cloud its arrival as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun </s>
<s> silently elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit poet behind her nick trailing behind him </s>
<s> she threw back a cushion over one of the seats unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it then presently straightened holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand </s>
<s> poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> elaine nodded </s>
<s> she kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion </s>
<s> nick asked apprehensively staring at the weapon </s>
<s> a moment later moving awkwardly because of the swimming fins she picked up the gun handed the knife to poet then rolled off the transom of the boat back first </s>
<s> poet nodded to nick and entered the water in a similar fashion </s>
<s> another moment and they were out of sight leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their whereabouts </s>
<s> for a while nick followed the twisting course of the bubbles wondering which set came from elaine </s>
<s> they remained close together their air trail wiggling like serpents traveling side by side </s>
<s> eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle of the ocean surface and he rolled over on his back </s>
<s> clasping his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky </s>
<s> there was nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean </s>
<s> alfredo certainly must have enjoyed being alone </s>
<s> next to the ocean probably the loneliest spot was the desert </s>
<s> yet alfredo wanted money wanted money to roam through the deserts </s>
<s> and graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in las vegas </s>
<s> it was an odd combination a strange pair to stumble upon the wreck of the trinidad </s>
<s> two to three weeks prior to the charter of the virginia graham had been snooping around the san luis rey mission </s>
<s> the small helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and nick raised up to watch it heading south </s>
<s> that was a hell of a note he thought </s>
<s> if the character flying that thing had gone over san clemente island yesterday he would have had an eyeful </s>
<s> off to the west a beautiful schooner slowly beat its way into the wind headed on a tack toward san clemente </s>
<s> behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small ground-swell a lone fisherman in the chair aft </s>
<s> the fisherman was right in the middle of the deep </s>
<s> nick recalled stories that the two best fishing spots in southern california were over the la jolla deep and the redondo deep two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the shoreline </s>
<s> someday geologists had warned the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the ocean and no more la jolla or redondo beach </s>
<s> meanwhile fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers </s>
<s> sometimes the fish exploded as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure </s>
<s> he stood up stretched looked around for the bubbles but could see none </s>
<s> strolling down to the galley he lit the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated poured himself a cup and went up to the chartroom </s>
<s> turning on the hi-fi he went back to the cockpit stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music </s>
<s> elaine and poet returned together popping up over the transom almost like dolphins breaking water </s>
<s> he sat up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> poet shook his head sliding his face mask up on his forehead </s>
<s> pulling off her face mask she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water </s>
<s> he tossed her a towel then repeated the service for poet </s>
<s> elaine shook her head as she slipped out of her harness but poet nodded </s>
<s> his feet still hung over the stern of the transom but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in </s>
<s> the fin on his foot caught on the moulding throwing him off balance </s>
<s> his forearm smashed painfully into the narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with his other hand and rolled into the boat </s>
<s> turning slowly he saw poet in a brilliant glare of horror </s>
<s> poet </s>
<s> his face was still creased in pain as he studied the underside of his arm </s>
<s> turning quickly toward elaine nick saw that she too stood in shocked surprise </s>
<s> the sudden silence was too silent </s>
<s> instinctively aware of the charged atmosphere poet raised his head slowly looking first at elaine </s>
<s> she had caught the implication of the oath </s>
<s> her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin her body absolutely motionless </s>
<s> and then nick knew that all of them knew elaine himself and poet </s>
<s> elaine recovered first so quickly that nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction </s>
<s> she asked steadily </s>
<s> poet rubbed his arm </s>
<s> elaine turned and started toward the companionway </s>
<s> but her walk was too steady too slow telegraphing her fear </s>
<s> nick sensed it </s>
<s> so did poet </s>
<s> springing like a cat he leaped back swooped up the spring gun and whirling pointed it toward the cabin </s>
<s> at the same instant nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man </s>
<s> the gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke of an old steam engine </s>
<s> at the same instant elaine screamed wildly the sound ending abruptly as nick went off the boat and into the water on top of the frantic struggling poet </s>
<s> the moment the sea closed over nick some atavistic sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic </s>
<s> but the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage </s>
<s> poet was the captured arms pinioned to his side and he twisted convulsively trying to escape </s>
<s> poet would escape nick thought grimly because he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under water </s>
<s> but nick would not let go </s>
<s> suddenly poet stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water not rising not sinking </s>
<s> a black snake-like object swayed eerily in front of him spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head </s>
<s> the air hose was free </s>
<s> the discovery struck nick like a blow </s>
<s> at the same instant he grabbed the loose writhing hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece </s>
<s> instinctively he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose </s>
<s> at once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden wild exultation </s>
<s> as if this was a signal poet abruptly began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water </s>
<s> relentlessly nick held on sucking on the hose inhaling the air that belonged to poet </s>
<s> poet was not fighting nick now </s>
<s> harbor point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a steamer clam </s>
<s> chief bob moore looked his same hick-self </s>
<s> a man mountain running to lard in his middle-age </s>
<s> hardly expected the head of county homicide up for this murder </s>

<s> probably the last of the original island indians </s>
<s> nellie was in the kitchen had just come to work when she heard tim arguing with julia in the living room </s>
<s> and then rushed out of the house </s>
<s> then she heard julia phone me </s>
<s> we walked up main street to this big white house then around to the back </s>
<s> the corpse was on a table covered by a sheet </s>
<s> doc abel was busy up front with some of his live patients </s>

<s> chief moore shook his big head seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body </s>
<s> i dropped the sheet glanced at my watch </s>
<s> still i wanted to get this over with had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office </s>
<s> five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house and when the jaguar stopped i managed to swallow </s>
<s> there was a garage and a modern barn in the rear all of it standing between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes </s>
<s> everything shouted gentleman farming the kind of grandfather-father-to-son folding money the point is known for </s>
<s> the fins of a caddy were sticking out of the garage while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture </s>
<s> she was also stone deaf in her right ear </s>
<s> she calmly repeated what moore had told me </s>
<s> i do the living room last </s>
<s> miss julia was a hard woman with a dollar </s>
<s> i drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil </s>
<s> the wrinkled mouth laughed revealing astonishingly strong white teeth </s>
<s> i walked into the living room </s>
<s> look jed this is an open and shut case and i have to relieve my men at the road block soon </s>
<s> in late summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these </s>
<s> now they were empty except for a cottage across the road </s>
<s> the inside of their place was full of new furniture five bucks down and a buck a week stuff but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home </s>
<s> mrs williams was both sullen and frightened </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> tim is a good man hard working </s>
<s> he strong as a bull but gentle as a baby </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> she shook her head </s>
<s> i knew she was lying </s>
<s> we made it back to the harbor in less than four minutes </s>
<s> i tried not to act scared </s>
<s> that jaguar could really barrel along </s>
<s> i told moore i was going to eat get some forms filled out by doc abel </s>
<s> lighting my pipe i took a walk </s>
<s> the harbor is a big yachting basin in the summer </s>
<s> even now there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater </s>
<s> as i was walking back to the police station which was in the same building with the city hall and post office i saw mrs tim williams sneaking into the back of my car </s>
<s> if she moved gracefully she was clumsy at it </s>
<s> i got into the front seat </s>
<s> i drove out of the harbor turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped </s>
<s> i waited a few minutes and she sat up </s>
<s> she puffed on the cigarette slowly sitting slumped against the back seat </s>
<s> but the police have dropped the case </s>
<s> take the same train diana beauclerk took and get there at the same time </s>
<s> the police have finished with it </s>
<s> alec was growing more and more skeptical </s>
<s> the hotel people will have scoured and vacuumed it </s>
<s> interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited on beauclerk </s>
<s> study the topography of the suite </s>
<s> soak up local color </s>
<s> reenact everything beauclerk did </s>
<s> alec smirked </s>
<s> a sudden thought wiped the smirk from his face </s>
<s> he spoke softly </s>
<s> after all the murderer is still at large </s>
<s> diana beauclerk was a second-rate actress living in new york </s>
<s> two weeks ago she had gone west to pearson city </s>
<s> daniel forbes her divorced husband lived there </s>
<s> so did the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce kimball and stacy </s>
<s> she reached pearson city at nine pm and went straight to the hotel westmore </s>
<s> she telephoned the junior partner of her law firm martin stacy and asked him to call at her hotel that evening </s>
<s> at the time of her divorce forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in lieu of further alimony if she remarried </s>
<s> according to stacy she told him she was planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask forbes for the lump sum </s>
<s> stacy replied that it would bankrupt forbes who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture </s>
<s> stacy said he left her suite at nine forty-five pm </s>
<s> she was in good health and spirits but still determined to get the money from forbes </s>
<s> no one saw stacy leave </s>
<s> no other visitor inquired for her that evening </s>
<s> next morning she was found dead in her suite with a bullet from a </s>
<s> colt revolver in her brain </s>
<s> according to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven pm and one am </s>
<s> her door was locked and the key was missing </s>
<s> so was the gun </s>
<s> when alec finished reading he was sure that either forbes or stacy had killed diana beauclerk </s>
<s> forbes had motive and stacy had opportunity </s>
<s> find a motive for stacy or an opportunity for forbes and the case would be solved </s>
<s> the hotel westmore proved to be one of the older hotels in pearson city and definitely second-rate </s>
<s> he studied the night clerk as a man measures an adversary </s>
<s> the clerk was young and limp with a tired smile </s>
<s> he always looked impertinent and he could look dangerous </s>
<s> he was looking dangerous now </s>
<s> he raised his voice </s>
<s> there was a sudden stillness in the lobby </s>
<s> two women who had been chattering like parrots were struck dumb </s>
<s> a man lighting a match for his cigar paused until the flame burned his fingers </s>
<s> even the bellboys on their bench were listening </s>
<s> the clerk was almost hysterical </s>
<s> it was blackmail and the clerk knew it </s>
<s> the stillness persisted as alec followed a bellboy across the lobby to the elevator </s>
<s> he could feel eyes on his back </s>
<s> he wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly </s>
<s> the corridor on the eleventh floor was dimly lighted by electric globes at intervals of thirty feet </s>
<s> a thick crimson carpet muffled every footfall </s>
<s> at the end of the corridor alec noticed a door marked fire stairs </s>
<s> it was a neat setup for murder </s>
<s> the room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window </s>
<s> a few snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow languid as falling feathers </s>
<s> hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light </s>
<s> the room looked normal and even commonplace </s>
<s> there was no hint of a violent struggle now </s>
<s> deal furniture with a mahogany finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store </s>
<s> the blue rug was suspiciously bright and new </s>
<s> it had never been stained with blood </s>
<s> table covers and towels were clean ashtrays empty and supplied with fresh matches </s>
<s> the mirror over the bureau was a blank eye round and innocent </s>
<s> alec played the part of an innocent tourist </s>
<s> the boy dropped his eyes </s>
<s> the boy raised his eyes </s>
<s> the boy hesitated </s>
<s> he was in a hurry to get out of the room </s>
<s> alec gave him a tip and let him go </s>
<s> alone alec examined the doors </s>
<s> alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table </s>
<s> it was just quarter of nine </s>
<s> as he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover </s>
<s> not gray like the dust that collects in an unused room but white </s>
<s> they used pink tan or cream powder </s>
<s> alec glanced into the bathroom </s>
<s> blood in the bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands </s>
<s> it seemed clean now but alec decided against a bath </s>
<s> he crawled into bed and switched off the light </s>
<s> in the darkness he could see the rosy reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window </s>
<s> in less than five minutes alec was asleep </s>
<s> he never knew just what woke him </s>
<s> yet suddenly he was wide-awake </s>
<s> there was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on the wall </s>
<s> he lay still listening to the silence watching the light </s>
<s> according to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven pm and one am </s>
<s> alec heard a faint sound </s>
<s> his heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest </s>
<s> for the sound was inside the room </s>
<s> he let his eyelids droop and breathed heavily feigning sleep </s>
<s> the sound was coming nearer </s>
<s> a monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall distorted and indefinable </s>
<s> when the neon sign faded out the shadow disappeared </s>
<s> when the neon sign flashed on the shadow was still there </s>
<s> it stretched to an impossible height climbing the wall to the ceiling </s>
<s> cautiously alec tensed his muscles ready to jump </s>
<s> the bedsprings betrayed him with a creak </s>
<s> the shadow vanished </s>
<s> someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window </s>
<s> abandoning caution alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch </s>
<s> before he could snap it on a stinging blow caught him in the ribs </s>
<s> he lashed out blindly with his right </s>
<s> there was a thick squashy crack of fist on flesh </s>
<s> something hard grazed his knuckles </s>
<s> he put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be </s>
<s> rough cloth rasped his fist </s>
<s> there was a grunt curiously inarticulate like that of an animal in pain </s>
<s> something heavy shook the floor as it dropped </s>
<s> alec waited a moment on guard </s>
<s> nothing happened </s>
<s> again he groped for the light switch </s>
<s> the blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room </s>
<s> on the bare floorboards a man lay face down </s>
<s> he had a short heavy powerful body </s>
<s> alec promptly removed the gun </s>
<s> he was familiar with this type </s>
<s> he had seen it in the lineup at police headquarters in new york in broadway night clubs and seventh avenue pool rooms in the criminal courts </s>
<s> but he was surprised to meet it here </s>
<s> diana beauclerk had no connection with the underworld </s>
<s> a professional gunman would not have killed her with a weapon of such small caliber as a </s>
<s> nor would he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be so much safer to take his victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country road </s>
<s> he opened his eyes </s>
<s> demanded alec </s>
<s> the man made no reply </s>
<s> his eyes were dazed </s>
<s> his lips were bruised and swollen where alec had hit him </s>
<s> alec expected an indignant denial but there was no response at all </s>
<s> the man opened his mouth but no words came </s>
<s> only that curious animal grunting alec had heard during their fight </s>
<s> the man opened his mouth wider </s>
<s> a forefinger pointed toward his gullet </s>
<s> alec leaned forward to look </s>
<s> there were hideous scars inside the throat and the palate was mutilated </s>
<s> in good time i shall get to the distressing actuality to red mciver and handley walker to murder and sudden death </s>
<s> but you realize i am sure how much old deeds incite to new ones and you must forgive me if i tell you first of the old ones </s>
<s> he was sharpening his razor </s>
<s> much i assure you </s>
<s> you must know what gets into people even such as red and handley before you can tell what comes out of them </s>
<s> they had learned both of them about abraham wharf </s>
<s> his ghost is not laid </s>
<s> red and handley god help them knew the old dogtown lore </s>
<s> yes gentlemen i am getting to the point to my point </s>
<s> you know the facts </s>
<s> they are set forth in your own newspapers </s>
<s> you want from me the story but a story is about why and then perhaps about how </s>
<s> the when you know </s>
<s> yesterday morning </s>
<s> places too have their haunting qualities </s>
<s> even people </s>
<s> and my point in this sad story is the spirit of the matter </s>
<s> now dogtown is one of those places that creeps into the marrow as worms get into old wood under the veneer </s>
<s> in fact all the folk who lived on the back of cape ann they are not just like others </s>
<s> there were no witch burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family </s>
<s> after that he was never known to run or even walk fast </s>
<s> today dogtown is the only deserted village in all new england that i know of </s>
<s> there it sits a small highland with towns like gloucester near by </s>
<s> scientists say it is the last spewings of a great glacier but one rather feels that only a malevolent giant could have piled up those crouching monsters of granite which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended ominous life in them </s>
<s> and not one single dwelling left there though once in the early eighteenth century there were close to a hundred houses </s>
<s> a fascinating pursuit i assure you </s>
<s> it is now a sweep of boulders and ledges with oak walnut and sumac creeping across the common and everywhere the ruins and the long long shadows </s>
<s> please get that in your reports </s>
<s> it accounts for so many things </s>
<s> both red mciver and handley walker lived nearby almost as near as i do </s>
<s> handley lived further on at pigeon cove </s>
<s> sea-road railroad lack of water killed dogtown </s>
<s> i knew red and handley well </s>
<s> as i said they were both painters </s>
<s> they married cousins anta and freya norberg </s>
<s> there are a lot of scandinavians in this neck of the woods and many still make painted furniture and take steam-baths </s>
<s> pretty girls among them with blonde hair and pert faces </s>
<s> handley married freya and red of the red beard married anta </s>
<s> and it was because of an old norberg inheritance that i got to understand them all so well </s>
<s> the quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw but i must tell you about it </s>
<s> you see besides being custodian of antiquities i am also registrar </s>
<s> i know as well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries where the live wind blows and not from the hull </s>
<s> about five years ago handley came to ask me if he could see the tattered register </s>
<s> he was courteous and casual about it as though it were of no consequence </s>
<s> like his glossy black hair </s>
<s> too many outside manners to my taste </s>
<s> he is the sort who with an appraising eye would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her </s>
<s> a real gentleman i feel would do neither </s>
<s> the next week cousin red wandered in as casually but curt and untidy </s>
<s> red was small and fine-boned like ivory-inlay </s>
<s> he too asked to see the same page </s>
<s> when i told him someone had torn it out he shouted </s>
<s> and later in the same week they both came together to examine the register </s>
<s> red thrusting out his tawny beard handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair </s>
<s> they actually bristled </s>
<s> le rouge et le noir </s>
<s> violent men both </s>
<s> red always was morose yet that day the dapper handley was the louder of the two </s>
<s> but for my presence they would have been at each others throats </s>
<s> during the quarrel i learned what the trouble was from the accusations each hurled at the other </s>
<s> the beech pasture had suddenly become valuable </s>
<s> fortunately i knew almost exactly what the will had said </s>
<s> it began with a preamble of course </s>
<s> and i remember that the whole of the privileges not counting the beech pasture was valued at twenty pounds </s>
<s> i wish you could have seen the crests fall on these two sparring coxcombs when i told them that obviously the pasture belonged to their wives jointly </s>
<s> that battle scene ridiculous as it was remained in my mind </s>
<s> i felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence </s>
<s> not that i intentionally go unperceived but the boulders up there are very high and i am a small woman </s>
<s> one other cause of jealousy between them i must tell you </s>
<s> paint </s>
<s> gloomy and unkempt as red mciver was he was much the better painter </s>
<s> i suppose handley knew it </s>
<s> if red had a show at gloucester handley would hurry to hang his pictures in rockport </s>
<s> you may say this has little pertinence but gentlemen remember that all this prepared my mind alerted my intelligence </s>
<s> by such touches the pattern takes shape </s>
<s> you would call these the motives of crime </s>
<s> i would call them the patterns of life perhaps even the designs of destiny </s>
<s> yet with all this knowledge i had nothing of substance to unravel our case as you would call it till yesterday </s>
<s> not much to shoot but there are a few pheasant </s>
<s> any more than they have the sense to eat mussels </s>
<s> that was the day red was said to have gone away </s>
<s> anta his wife never seemed to mind </s>
<s> i suppose these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with cousin handley </s>
<s> it would have been a good excuse for his being there at all </s>
<s> haney peered doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary tear-filled eyes </s>
<s> he had no ready answer as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing </s>
<s> the guy is off his rocker haney thought to himself and looked away from those eyes </s>
<s> eyes that were clear but also bright with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burning behind them </s>
<s> no the man was not drunk </s>
<s> he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger </s>
<s> but of course he remembered now </s>
<s> it was blurred after two hours of steady drinking but the occasion of it came back to him </s>
<s> the stranger his head seemingly sunk in thought started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection </s>
<s> his shout had been involuntary something anybody might have done without thinking on the spur of the moment </s>
<s> actually he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them </s>
<s> by then the stranger was thanking haney profusely and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend </s>
<s> so the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his safe-driving record </s>
<s> very suddenly the driver stopped swearing at them turned on his heel and went back to his truck </s>
<s> now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off </s>
<s> it must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word </s>
<s> when the light went their way they went on across the street </s>
<s> and when the stranger found out that phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them </s>
<s> phil usually went alone and kept to himself sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges </s>
<s> phil was like that </s>
<s> now he wondered if it was worth it having a screwball for company </s>
<s> haney managed a weak laugh </s>
<s> i meant it </s>
<s> and everybody has some kind of grudge </s>
<s> i believe in returning favors </s>
<s> phil rubbed his forehead wearily </s>
<s> he was beginning to feel woolly </s>
<s> maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit </s>
<s> the man closed his eyes and nodded </s>
<s> when he looked up again he seemed almost contented </s>
<s> give me your address </s>
<s> it will take a little time </s>
<s> you see i always make it look like an accident </s>
<s> maybe suicide if it looks reasonable </s>
<s> pete smiled modestly </s>
<s> five minutes later before haney could make his break the stranger stood up and nodded farewell </s>
<s> haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure </s>
<s> phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for the other glass on the table </s>
<s> some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the sack putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep </s>
<s> the next day sunday the hangover reminded haney where he had been the night before </s>
<s> the hangover in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy and he groaned </s>
<s> phil shrugged and ignored him </s>
<s> he went back to work monday </s>
<s> by wednesday the landlord was still alive </s>
<s> of course on thursday haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife lolly and wished the stranger could do something about her </s>
<s> coming home from work he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building </s>
<s> inside the lobby people were standing around talking excitedly </s>
<s> his spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened </s>
<s> the landlord had died </s>
<s> late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection </s>
<s> he had apparently been alone </s>
<s> haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks </s>
<s> he muttered something about how terrible it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator </s>
<s> once inside his apartment he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair </s>
<s> after a while he began to feel better about it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions </s>
<s> the stranger really had nothing to do with it of course </s>
<s> haney went to bed happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord </s>
<s> after all the man had no family so no one suffered and everybody was better off for it </s>
<s> really he said to himself nobody kills a man just as a favor </s>
<s> it was like a recurrent annoying dream but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare </s>
<s> however haney knew it was not a dream </s>
<s> he might be very tight but he knew where he was </s>
<s> he had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as far as possible from any talkative friendly lushes </s>
<s> he was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water </s>
<s> this favorite grievance was not the landlord </s>
<s> he had already quite forgotten about him </s>
<s> in fact he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment </s>
<s> his real grievance was lolly </s>
<s> toward the end of his fourth hairy highball while he was moodily making wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass he became aware that he was not alone </s>
<s> he looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld the stranger sitting across the table smiling a secret smile at him as if they were fellow conspirators </s>
<s> the man was uncanny like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow </s>
<s> haney felt like shrinking out of sight but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry dark little man </s>
<s> in a low voice almost whispering the man had asked phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back </s>
<s> he made the mistake of answering in an offhand way and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice </s>
<s> pete frowned slightly then became sad and moody </s>
<s> but there was no trouble </s>
<s> to break the uncomfortable silence haney began to talk </s>
<s> when he paused to moisten his throat the stranger broke in </s>
<s> haney scowled </s>
<s> pete nodded understandingly </s>
<s> now i see </s>
<s> i came out here to retire </s>
<s> haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again </s>
<s> then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain </s>
<s> a retired professional killer if he was just a nut no harm was done </s>
<s> but if he was the real thing he could do something about lolly </s>
<s> he shrugged casually </s>
<s> his eyes burned feverishly </s>
<s> let me prove it phil </s>
<s> he waited eagerly </s>
<s> haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass </s>
<s> about halfway back pops groped against a wall and stopped pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end and went through </s>
<s> i went through and down into pitch darkness </s>
<s> i jist stayed where i was while he fumbled around and then walked away </s>
<s> a moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle and i could see </s>
<s> i looked back over my shoulder while i went to join him </s>
<s> i took the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as i sat down beside him on the spread blanket </s>
<s> he drank and handed it back </s>
<s> i know where he is right near here </s>
<s> i took a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him </s>
<s> he put the bottle down </s>
<s> charlie was waiting leaning against a building front </s>
<s> on the way i gave him the scoop </s>
<s> i bought another pint of sherry and when we got back pops let us in in the dark put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again </s>
<s> i introduced my friend larry to pops and we made ourselves comfortable </s>
<s> there was still a little not much left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it and charlie opened his </s>
<s> and a blaring final chord from the jazz group </s>
<s> this was the same except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves </s>
<s> but we could wait all right </s>
<s> there was no hurry </s>
<s> the second bottle passed a few times </s>
<s> pops was taking long ones but not showing the effect yet </s>
<s> he had a capacity </s>
<s> it was a lead pipe cinch </s>
<s> there was a sound like the one you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger only louder and pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise </s>
<s> out cold if not dead </s>
<s> he was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me </s>
<s> i gauged that blow to be borderline </s>
<s> to kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill </s>
<s> i dug him i saw his point </s>
<s> it made sense </s>
<s> the thunk was louder anyway and i thought i heard bone crack </s>
<s> we straightened pops up and i made sure there was no trace of a heartbeat </s>
<s> i nodded to charlie </s>
<s> we did that </s>
<s> charlie asked me </s>
<s> it was a kick but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for stakes </s>
<s> now first question the bottles </s>
<s> this happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum </s>
<s> same goes for the rough cement of the ledge </s>
<s> besides i doubt if the cops will even try dusting </s>
<s> our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets </s>
<s> we did that and found a dirty handkerchief some matches and fourteen cents in change </s>
<s> he might not be found for days even weeks otherwise </s>
<s> we went once more over every point then triple-checked </s>
<s> in fact nobody saw us cop or citizen </s>
<s> winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour </s>
<s> which if it matters was one am </s>
<s> it had gone like clockwork </s>
<s> almost too smoothly i found myself thinking and then told myself that was ridiculous </s>
<s> thinking like that can get you into a padded pad </s>
<s> an hour later we were back in my unpadded pad killing what had been left of the second pint </s>
<s> we decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow </s>
<s> but we were really going to do it </s>
<s> we shook hands on it </s>
<s> we planned ahead only one step a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes </s>
<s> charlie would get there early because he had the key </s>
<s> i was dead tired and slept soundly as far as i know dreamlessly </s>
<s> i talked first telling him everything i knew about seaton and his house and domestic arrangements </s>
<s> i drew diagrams and floor plans </s>
<s> he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down </s>
<s> he sighed </s>
<s> a couple of hundred </s>
<s> i took a deep breath and the plunge </s>
<s> he grinned and clapped me on the shoulder </s>
<s> now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers merge without let </s>
<s> mike remained in trance </s>
<s> he studied them compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling struggling to bridge between languages the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in </s>
<s> he was closer to understanding it in english now although it could never have the inevitability of the martian concept it stood for </s>
<s> in his mind he spoke simultaneously the english sentence and the martian word and felt closer grokking </s>
<s> repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus he sank into nirvana </s>
<s> before midnight he speeded his heart resumed normal breathing ran down his check list uncurled and sat up </s>
<s> he had been weary </s>
<s> now he felt light and gay and clear-headed ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him </s>
<s> he felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet </s>
<s> he stepped out into the hall was delighted to encounter a water brother </s>
<s> hello mike </s>
<s> mike felt disappointed that mahmoud had left </s>
<s> he wanted to explain his new grokking </s>
<s> they went downstairs loaded a tray lavishly </s>
<s> he could see in almost total darkness </s>
<s> jubal said that his night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up and mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it </s>
<s> his foster parents had taught him to see </s>
<s> as for the night being warm he would have been comfortable naked on mount everest but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure </s>
<s> he was considerate of their weakness once he learned of it </s>
<s> in the meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water brother </s>
<s> mike liked having light up through the ripples </s>
<s> it was a goodness beauty </s>
<s> they picnicked by the pool then lay back on the grass and looked at stars </s>
<s> he hesitated </s>
<s> the question was too wide for the sparse english language </s>
<s> he hesitated </s>
<s> i have helped him </s>
<s> he thought </s>
<s> mike had not heard it </s>
<s> he had not known it until asked </s>
<s> mr booker t w jones food technician first class is not sad </s>
<s> he had his own face dark and beautiful </s>
<s> he rolled toward her and took her in his arms </s>
<s> presently his water brother said breathlessly </s>
<s> yes indeed </s>
<s> it is for growing closer </s>
<s> turn just a little </s>
<s> her answer was not in words </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> on mars humans were building pressure domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship </s>
<s> this went faster than scheduled as the martians were helpful </s>
<s> part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations </s>
<s> the old ones neither helped nor hindered this plan </s>
<s> time was not yet </s>
<s> their meditations were approaching a violent cusp that would shape martian art for many millennia </s>
<s> on earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation marks and spaces </s>
<s> time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the federation assembly daily record should be translated into the medium </s>
<s> a tibetan swami from palermo sicily announced in beverly hills a newly discovered ancient yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction between sexes </s>
<s> the purpose was less immediate </s>
<s> a funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting </s>
<s> digby was not pleased with his promotion </s>
<s> eternity is no time for recriminations </s>
<s> you too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me </s>
<s> afterwards you did well enough </s>
<s> same as with the popes </s>
<s> some of them were warts until they got promoted </s>
<s> digby calmed down but made one request </s>
<s> foster shook his halo </s>
<s> oh you can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself </s>
<s> the boss wants performance not gripes </s>
<s> if you need a day off to calm down duck over to the muslim paradise and take it </s>
<s> otherwise straighten your halo square your wings and dig in </s>
<s> digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh </s>
<s> his household had gone through an upset </s>
<s> mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches </s>
<s> anyhow it was high time the boy was salted </s>
<s> this continued most of the week following that ill-starred trip to church during which period mike stayed in his room and usually in a trance so deep that jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before </s>
<s> jubal would not have minded it if service had not gone to pieces </s>
<s> absent-minded subject to unexplained tears jubal would have bet his life that if anne were to witness the second coming she would memorize date time personae events and barometric pressure without batting her calm blue eyes </s>
<s> the expense and time involved are astronomical </s>
<s> however we sent a third vessel out a much smaller and faster one than the first two </s>
<s> we have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago </s>
<s> that is all i can tell you about them </s>
<s> said hal forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak </s>
<s> macneff stopped pacing to stare at hal with his pale blue eyes </s>
<s> he said sharply </s>
<s> thought hal </s>
<s> besides they were not the only impressions </s>
<s> i still bear scars on my back where pornsen my gapt whipped me because i had not learned my lessons well enough </s>
<s> he was a good impresser that pornsen </s>
<s> is </s>
<s> as i grew older and was promoted so was he always where i was </s>
<s> he was my gapt in the creche </s>
<s> he was the dormitory gapt when i went to college and thought i was getting away from him </s>
<s> he is now my block gapt </s>
<s> swiftly came the revulsion the protest </s>
<s> no not he for i and i alone am responsible for whatever happens to me </s>
<s> if i get a low m r i do so because i want it that way or my dark self does </s>
<s> if i die i die because i willed it so </s>
<s> so forgive me sigmen for the contrary-to-reality thoughts </s>
<s> the expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to earth </s>
<s> said hal </s>
<s> we have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion </s>
<s> hal waited macneff paced some more frowning </s>
<s> but from our reading of the western talmud we urielites believe that the forerunner knowing this situation would arise made reference to and provision for divorce </s>
<s> naturally he couched the provision in obscure language </s>
<s> six months later hal yarrow stood in the observation dome of the gabriel and watched the ball of earth dwindle above him </s>
<s> it was night on this hemisphere but the light blazed from the megalopolises of australia japan china southeast asia india siberia </s>
<s> hal the linguist saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein </s>
<s> australia the philippine islands japan and northern china were inhabited by those members of the haijac union that spoke american </s>
<s> southern china all of southeast asia southern india and ceylon these states of the malay federation spoke bazaar </s>
<s> siberia spoke icelandic </s>
<s> his mind turned the globe swiftly for him and he visualized africa which used swahili south of the sahara sea </s>
<s> all around the mediterranean sea asia minor northern india and tibet hebrew was the native tongue </s>
<s> in southern europe between the israeli republics and the icelandic-speaking peoples of northern europe was a thin but long stretch of territory called march </s>
<s> neither nation would give up their claim on it yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second apocalyptic war </s>
<s> hal saw in his mind the rest of earth iceland greenland the caribbean islands and the eastern half of south america </s>
<s> here the peoples spoke the tongue of iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the hawaiian-americans who were busy resettling north america and the western half of south america after the apocalyptic war </s>
<s> then there was north america where american was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of french-canadians living on the hudson bay preserve </s>
<s> hal knew that when that side of earth rotated into the night zone sigmen city would blaze out into space </s>
<s> and somewhere in that enormous light was his apartment </s>
<s> but mary would soon no longer be living there for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to tahiti </s>
<s> she would weep in private he was sure for she loved him in her frigid way though in public she would be dry-eyed </s>
<s> her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her not because she had lost a beloved husband but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically </s>
<s> if hal yarrow had been killed in a crash he must have wanted it that way </s>
<s> and therefore being in disgrace they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony </s>
<s> no the fish could eat their bodies for all the sturch cared </s>
<s> hal felt sorry for mary </s>
<s> he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome </s>
<s> yet he told himself this was the best way </s>
<s> he and mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each other </s>
<s> their mutual torture would be over </s>
<s> mary was free to marry again not knowing that the sturch had secretly given her a divorce thinking that death had dissolved her marriage </s>
<s> she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt </s>
<s> perhaps </s>
<s> hal doubted if this happy event would occur </s>
<s> mary was as frozen below the navel as he </s>
<s> no matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt </s>
<s> the gapt </s>
<s> pornsen </s>
<s> he would no longer have to see that fat face hear that whining voice </s>
<s> said the whining voice </s>
<s> and slowly feeling himself icy yet burning hal turned </s>
<s> there was the squat loose-jowled man smiling lopsidedly up at him </s>
<s> but i might have known </s>
<s> we seem to be bound by love </s>
<s> sigmen himself must have foreseen it </s>
<s> meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship went into the suspensor </s>
<s> here they would lie in suspended animation for many years </s>
<s> some time later after a check had been made of all automatic equipment the crew would join the others </s>
<s> many years later the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration </s>
<s> again a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied </s>
<s> then after slowing the vessel considerably the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration </s>
<s> and the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation </s>
<s> these members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel </s>
<s> and in the half-year left before reaching their destination the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed </s>
<s> hal yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out </s>
<s> he had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of ozagen siddo </s>
<s> and from the first he faced a difficult task </s>
<s> the expedition that had discovered ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand siddo words with an equal number of american words </s>
<s> the description of the siddo syntax was very restricted </s>
<s> and as hal found out obviously mistaken in many cases </s>
<s> this discovery caused hal anxiety </s>
<s> his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen </s>
<s> yet if he used all of the little means at his disposal he would be instructing his students wrongly </s>
<s> moreover even getting this across would be difficult </s>
<s> the sounds made by these organs were therefore dissimilar </s>
<s> another obstacle was the grammatical construction of siddo </s>
<s> consider the tense system </s>
<s> instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future siddo used an entirely different word </s>
<s> the same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses </s>
<s> fortunately gender was inflected though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in siddo </s>
<s> the system of indicating gender varied according to tense </s>
<s> all the other parts of speech nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs </s>
<s> this was not for the angel just a matter of running through a logical or deductive chain or deciding on some action from some already established premise </s>
<s> no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer </s>
<s> what gabriel was being asked to do now however was to re-examine all his basic assumptions make value-judgments on them and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives </s>
<s> being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause however did not make it seem any less long to jack </s>
<s> he had already become used to hesperus snapping back answers to questions almost before jack could get them asked </s>
<s> there was nothing he could do but wait </s>
<s> the dice were cast </s>
<s> at last gabriel spoke </s>
<s> of course we have before us the example of the great races at the galactic center </s>
<s> but they have survived for long periods as races whereas you are young </s>
<s> we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half </s>
<s> you may reclaim your property and the penalty on hesperus is lifted </s>
<s> his heart he discovered was pounding </s>
<s> between individuals this process is called bargaining </s>
<s> when it is done between races or nations it is called making a treaty </s>
<s> and the major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine </s>
<s> another pause </s>
<s> but this one was not nearly as long </s>
<s> of curiosity </s>
<s> of a more alive time </s>
<s> yes those could be commodities under this concept </s>
<s> but you should understand jack that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery </s>
<s> this explained a great deal </s>
<s> we will gladly entertain your young and give them proper living quarters in return for their help in running our fusion reactors </s>
<s> jack felt a wave of complete elation but in a second it had vanished without a trace </s>
<s> what gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments and contract to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless of the applicable earth laws </s>
<s> the simple treaty principle that gabriel was asking him to ratify in short was nothing less than total trust </s>
<s> nothing less would serve </s>
<s> and it might be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war </s>
<s> almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion not trust as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders </s>
<s> yet there was some precedent for it </s>
<s> the history of disarmament agreements for instance had been unreassuringly dismal </s>
<s> out of that agreement though not by any easy road eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations </s>
<s> suspicion between member states still existed but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry between arizona and california over water supplies </s>
<s> if mankind could be convinced of that </s>
<s> it was worth trying </s>
<s> in fact it had to be tried </s>
<s> it would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had ever signed </s>
<s> secretary hart had taught jack at least partially to be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters </s>
<s> but there was no small way to handle this one </s>
<s> he turned back to the screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his lips </s>
<s> but he was too late </s>
<s> he had lost his audience </s>
<s> for a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw </s>
<s> it seemed to be only a riot of color light and meaningless activity </s>
<s> gradually he realized that the pentagon of angel elders had vanished and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up </s>
<s> the angels in the nursery were zigzagging wildly in all directions seemingly at random </s>
<s> jack scanned the skies the boards and the skies again </s>
<s> nothing </s>
<s> and it was getting bigger rapidly </s>
<s> if that was the skiff it was making unprecedented speed </s>
<s> then the skiff hove into sight just a dot of light at first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks of the coal sack </s>
<s> through the telescope jack could see that both spacesuits were still attached to it </s>
<s> the sail was still unfurled though there were a good many holes in it as langer had predicted would be the case by now </s>
<s> it was a startling almost numenous sight </s>
<s> the skiff was not heading for the nursery however </s>
<s> it seemed unlikely that her crew if either of them were alive could even see the ariadne for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a light-year </s>
<s> fuming helpless he watched them pass him </s>
<s> the sail ragged though it was still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars </s>
<s> he would never have believed without seeing it that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast </s>
<s> it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off </s>
<s> langer would have to be headed off whether he knew where he was going or not </s>
<s> almost surely he did </s>
<s> after all he had had the same set of facts as jack had had to work from and he was an almost frighteningly observant man </s>
<s> but not having talked to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line </s>
<s> if it was intentional it was now also unnecessary </s>
<s> and whether intentional or not the outcome would be disastrous </s>
<s> jack crawled under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from the nernst generator switch </s>
<s> when he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses however he hesitated </s>
<s> he had to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he had to have it fast </s>
<s> if because of this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permitted to go there at all </s>
<s> with a short-lived sigh of relief jack plugged the fuses back in and threw the switch </s>
<s> of course </s>
<s> hesperus was in there </s>
<s> from here on out the ariadne was going to be hotter than any space cruiser man had ever dreamed of </s>
<s> but since he had failed to anticipate it he lost the five minutes anyhow in plotting an intercept orbit </s>
<s> ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow </s>
<s> he rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw </s>
<s> he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself </s>
<s> his small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face </s>
<s> ryan insisted </s>
<s> the facsiport rolled open on the landscape </s>
<s> a range of bluffs hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss </s>
<s> above them the sky was the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above minneapolis seen against neon-lit snow </s>
<s> that cold empty sky was full of fire and light </s>
<s> it seemed almost a magnification of the galaxy itself of the milky way blown up by some master photographer </s>
<s> this fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets almost like the asteroid belt in the original solar system </s>
<s> these planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere </s>
<s> but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of them did </s>
<s> ryan asked </s>
<s> he was the captain so he could ask questions like that </s>
<s> ekstrohm asked </s>
<s> this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago </s>
<s> ringing the ship </s>
<s> ryan told him what he could do then </s>
<s> ekstrohm smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall </s>
<s> the strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects </s>
<s> actually the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories </s>
<s> they ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance dropped to the ground </s>
<s> it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow </s>
<s> they walked from midnight to noon noon to midnight and came to the beast sprawled on its side </s>
<s> ekstrohm nudged it with a boot </s>
<s> well it has to happen </s>
<s> statistical average and all </s>
<s> still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world </s>
<s> the surveyor looked sidewise at the captain </s>
<s> the big man seldom gave out with such thoughts </s>
<s> ekstrohm cleared his throat </s>
<s> no hands for one thing </s>
<s> in the meantime we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent </s>
<s> ekstrohm suggested </s>
<s> maybe it would work the other way </s>
<s> suppose it is something right on the planet native to it </s>
<s> ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet </s>
<s> the earthmen made camp outside the spaceship </s>
<s> there was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out </s>
<s> the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being </s>
<s> each man had a bubble to himself privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on board the ship </s>
<s> there was a keening of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground </s>
<s> insects there were on the world but they were frozen solid during the night only to revive and thaw in the morning sun </s>
<s> the bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board </s>
<s> yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum </s>
<s> ekstrohm was not asleep </s>
<s> now there could be an end to pretending </s>
<s> he threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk to the floor </s>
<s> ekstrohm stood up </s>
<s> there was no longer any need to hide </s>
<s> he no longer had to lie in his bunk all night his eyes closed pretending to sleep </s>
<s> in privacy he could walk around leave the light on read </s>
<s> it was small comfort for insomnia </s>
<s> ekstrohm never slept </s>
<s> some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this </s>
<s> actually they said he did sleep but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot </s>
<s> his body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons </s>
<s> occasionally he fell into a waking gritty-eyed stupor </s>
<s> but he never slept </s>
<s> never at all </s>
<s> insomnia would ground him from the exploration service on physiological if not psychological grounds </s>
<s> he had to hide it </s>
<s> over the years he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide </s>
<s> the buddies invariably took advantage of him </s>
<s> a man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him </s>
<s> ekstrohm had to hide his secret </s>
<s> in a camp instead of shipboard hiding the secret was easier </s>
<s> but the secret itself was just as hard </s>
<s> on impulse he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble </s>
<s> ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air </s>
<s> behind him his mates stirred without waking </s>
<s> ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble </s>
<s> it took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting sleeplessly </s>
<s> the angry burnt-red face of ryan greeted him </s>
<s> ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt </s>
<s> there was no ring of animal corpses </s>
<s> nothing </s>
<s> nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze </s>
<s> ekstrohm demanded </s>
<s> this has got to be some kind of local phenomenon </s>
<s> now comes this </s>
<s> the tapes show that </s>
<s> it was not a new experience to ekstrohm </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> ryan shook his head </s>
<s> ekstrohm scowled </s>
<s> she lived and was given a name </s>
<s> helva </s>
<s> for her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant </s>
<s> soon they all were removed to central laboratory school where their delicate transformation began </s>
<s> instead of grabbing with hands she manipulated mechanical extensions </s>
<s> as she matured more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship </s>
<s> she would be among the elite of her kind </s>
<s> her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high </s>
<s> however no diagram of her brain patterns no early iq tests recorded certain essential facts about helva that central must eventually learn </s>
<s> they would have to bide their official time and see trusting that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her too as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession </s>
<s> a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships </s>
<s> brain ships were of course long past the experimental stages </s>
<s> most babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept their bodies small eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells </s>
<s> and very very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine </s>
<s> shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the universe </s>
<s> so for happy years helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates playing such games as stall power-seek studying her lessons in trajectory propulsion techniques computation logistics mental hygiene basic alien psychology philology space history law traffic codes all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning logical informed citizen </s>
<s> not so obvious to her but of more importance to her teachers helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid </s>
<s> she would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction </s>
<s> when they were forced to central worlds shrugged its shoulders arranged a tour of the laboratory schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories complete with photographs </s>
<s> very few committees ever looked past the first few photos </s>
<s> she had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel </s>
<s> she had tuned her sight to the proper degree </s>
<s> as she worked she absentmindedly crooned producing a curious sound </s>
<s> shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths </s>
<s> her hum became a gurgle of surprise </s>
<s> although this was the first time that helva had seen unshelled people she took this experience calmly </s>
<s> any other reaction would have been reported instantly </s>
<s> helva asked politely </s>
<s> she instinctively sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further meditation </s>
<s> asked the lady </s>
<s> helva turned her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically </s>
<s> if she could have blushed she would have </s>
<s> in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last supper on the head of a screw </s>
<s> the good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time </s>
<s> if the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school they left helva with a morsel as well </s>
<s> shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis </s>
<s> balanced properly between optimism and practicality the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves their ships and personnel from bizarre situations </s>
<s> she would work out a method by-passing her limitations whereby she could sing </s>
<s> she approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries human and instrumental </s>
<s> her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal </s>
<s> breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice </s>
<s> shell people did not strictly speaking breathe </s>
<s> for their purposes oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells </s>
<s> after experimentation helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone </s>
<s> by relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the frontal sinuses she could direct the vowel sounds into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone </s>
<s> she compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them not at all unharmonious merely unique </s>
<s> acquiring a repertoire from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall </s>
<s> she found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy </s>
<s> it would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo soprano and coloratura as she pleased </s>
<s> it was to helva only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted </s>
<s> if the authorities remarked on her curious avocation they did so among themselves </s>
<s> shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work </s>
<s> on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship the aj </s>
<s> her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship </s>
<s> the neural audio visual and sensory connections were made and sealed </s>
<s> her extendibles were diverted connected or augmented and the final delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings </s>
<s> when she awoke she was the ship </s>
<s> her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed </s>
<s> she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine </s>
<s> her first actual flight for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession </s>
<s> she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner </s>
<s> there were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day helva was commissioned </s>
<s> there were several missions which demanded instant attention but helva had been of interest to several department heads in central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section </s>
<s> consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective partners </s>
<s> the ship always chose its own partner </s>
<s> tanner wisecracked </s>
<s> she asked hopefully as she recognized the scout service uniform </s>
<s> even to herself helva sounded a little self-pitying but the truth was she was lonely sitting on the darkened field </s>
<s> always she had had the company of other shells and more recently technicians by the score </s>
<s> the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive </s>
<s> it would have killed you in the cabin </s>
<s> mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm </s>
<s> he stumbled and fell but it did not hurt </s>
<s> the many-bodied girl lay near him </s>
<s> mercer spoke to her </s>
<s> the woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them </s>
<s> she radiated warmth and good fellowship </s>
<s> mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming </s>
<s> he struggled out of his clothes </s>
<s> it was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did </s>
<s> the two women babbled and crooned at him </s>
<s> with one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing just expressing the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it </s>
<s> with most of his mind he was happy </s>
<s> he wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this </s>
<s> a painful stab hit him in the abdomen </s>
<s> the drug went after the pain and swallowed it </s>
<s> it was like the cap in the hospital only a thousand times better </s>
<s> the pain was gone though it had been crippling the first time </s>
<s> he forced himself to be deliberate </s>
<s> maybe i will grow another head </s>
<s> the lady da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position </s>
<s> i can talk </s>
<s> remember man remember </s>
<s> people never live forever </s>
<s> we can die too we can die like real people </s>
<s> mercer smiled at her through his happiness </s>
<s> with this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack </s>
<s> he was wide awake but he did not feel like doing anything </s>
<s> in that beautiful place among all those companionable and attractive people he sat and smiled </s>
<s> mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted him </s>
<s> he endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement </s>
<s> the agonies of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him but meant nothing </s>
<s> he watched his own body with remote casual interest </s>
<s> the lady da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him </s>
<s> after a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms </s>
<s> having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at them and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged </s>
<s> mercer saw the sun rise on occasion closed his eyes briefly and opened them to see stars shining </s>
<s> time had no meaning </s>
<s> the dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way </s>
<s> the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body </s>
<s> at last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain </s>
<s> the pains themselves had not changed </s>
<s> he had </s>
<s> he knew all the events which could take place on shayol </s>
<s> he remembered them well from his happy period </s>
<s> he tried to ask the lady da how long they had had the drug and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again </s>
<s> she smiled at him with benign remote happiness </s>
<s> apparently her many torsos stretched out along the ground had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body </s>
<s> she meant him well but was in no condition for articulate speech </s>
<s> the half-man lay on the ground arteries pulsating prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity </s>
<s> the half-man woke recognized mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin </s>
<s> we all know what is going to happen </s>
<s> we all know when it is going to happen </s>
<s> asked mercer </s>
<s> the half-man laughed with something close to real humor </s>
<s> a scene is just a part of a play </s>
<s> the pain seems short and the pleasure seems long </s>
<s> when mercer looked on helplessly the half-man twisted over on his side his pink dusty back turned to mercer and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself </s>
<s> it might have been several days </s>
<s> it might have been several months </s>
<s> once again they clustered like children </s>
<s> mercer got the blissful needle </s>
<s> he saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut </s>
<s> the next time it was two legs growing from his chest </s>
<s> then there had been another head beside his own </s>
<s> he forgot the order </s>
<s> he did not count time </s>
<s> lady da smiled at him often but there was no love in this place </s>
<s> she had lost the extra torsos </s>
<s> in between teratologies she was a pretty and shapely woman </s>
<s> she found this immensely comforting even though mercer did not make much sense out of it </s>
<s> thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and new ones arrived </s>
<s> the bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them </s>
<s> he had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it </s>
<s> when he said it they thought it exceedingly profound though none of them understood it since it was simply the amount of time that mercer had been on shayol </s>
<s> mercer turned away </s>
<s> his own fate he accepted </s>
<s> the dromozoa kept him alive but he did not know how they did it </s>
<s> he staggered back to the group </s>
<s> the lady da naked in the dusty plain waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her </s>
<s> there were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less </s>
<s> the years if they were years went by </s>
<s> the land of shayol did not change </s>
<s> sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the plain to the herd of men </s>
<s> those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of captain alvarez </s>
<s> there was night and day but no setting of crops no change of season no generations of men </s>
<s> time stood still for these people and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the lady da took on very remote meaning </s>
<s> her statement was a hope not a truth in which they could believe </s>
<s> they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all </s>
<s> there was no dream of escape for these people </s>
<s> far long ago some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter </s>
<s> his handwriting was on a rock </s>
<s> mercer read it and so had a few of the others but they could not tell which man had done it </s>
<s> nor did they care </s>
<s> the letter scraped on stone had been a message home </s>
<s> once like you i had one head two hands ten fingers on my hands </s>
<s> the front part of my head was called a face and i could talk with it </s>
<s> now i can only write and that only when i get out of pain </s>
<s> dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner </s>
<s> he was well rid of her </s>
<s> but all of this was rationalization </s>
<s> sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of ann and then could not get back to sleep </s>
<s> his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing </s>
<s> the best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work </s>
<s> he found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake </s>
<s> each day he found himself thinking less often of ann </s>
<s> each day the hurt was a little duller a little less poignant </s>
<s> he had plenty of work to do </s>
<s> because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years </s>
<s> the grass in the meadows came fast now that the warm weather was here </s>
<s> he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows </s>
<s> he had no idea how much time budd would give him </s>
<s> in any case he had no intention of being caught asleep so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence </s>
<s> he stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm </s>
<s> when in late afternoon on the last day in june he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle </s>
<s> it could be some kind of trick budd had thought up </s>
<s> no one walked in this country least of all ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew </s>
<s> morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled </s>
<s> when they were closer and he saw that one was a woman he was more puzzled than ever </s>
<s> he cleaned his shovel left it against the fence picked up his winchester and started downstream </s>
<s> his visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow angling toward the house </s>
<s> now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly staggering as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet </s>
<s> reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his winchester in his hands </s>
<s> they crawled through the north fence and came on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen or twenty </s>
<s> they were dirty their clothes were torn and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door </s>
<s> she lay there making no effort to get back on her feet </s>
<s> the boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring </s>
<s> morgan hesitated thinking that if this was a trick it was a good one </s>
<s> the boy licked his dry lips </s>
<s> morgan jerked his head toward the front door </s>
<s> leaning his winchester against the front of the house he walked to the girl </s>
<s> her face was very thin and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling the new skin under it red and angry </s>
<s> her blond hair was frowzy her dress torn in several places and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection </s>
<s> it must have hurt her even to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding </s>
<s> he picked her up sliding one hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her into the house </s>
<s> any lingering suspicion that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled </s>
<s> no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him </s>
<s> besides she had a sweet face that attracted him </s>
<s> he put her down on the couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table </s>
<s> they looked a good deal alike morgan thought </s>
<s> both had blonde hair and blue eyes and there was even a faint similarity of features </s>
<s> he stood looking down at her for a moment wondering what could have reduced her to this condition </s>
<s> he had seen a few nester wagons go through the country the families almost starving to death but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two </s>
<s> the girl dropped off to sleep </s>
<s> morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove </s>
<s> he brought his winchester in from the front of the house then faced the boy </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> morgan nodded </s>
<s> jones sighed as if relieved </s>
<s> morgan demanded </s>
<s> he was silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if the girl could cook it would give him more time in the meadows but he knew nothing about the couple </s>
<s> they might kill him in his sleep thinking there was money in the house </s>
<s> he dismissed the possibility at once </s>
<s> there was more to this than jones had told him </s>
<s> they were running from something </s>
<s> morgan filled the fire box with wood again then started supper and set the table </s>
<s> when the meal was ready he told jones to wash up and going into the front room woke the girl </s>
<s> she rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her hair </s>
<s> this is the rafter aj </s>
<s> you fell down in front of the house and i carried you in </s>
<s> she stared at him her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said </s>
<s> she got to her feet staggered and almost fell </s>
<s> he caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen </s>
<s> she sat down at the table shaking her head </s>
<s> the girl cried </s>
<s> he told himself he had never seen two people eat so much </s>
<s> the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed of himself </s>
<s> morgan laughed </s>
<s> she helped him with the dishes then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark </s>
<s> he carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall </s>
<s> your feet are in bad shape mrs jones </s>
<s> the girl asked </s>
<s> he nodded and going into the bedroom brought a needle thread and scissors </s>
<s> he nodded at the door in front of him </s>
<s> jones followed him into the front room closing the door behind him </s>
<s> they were a pair of lost whipped kids morgan thought as he went to bed </s>
<s> gavin paused wearily </s>
<s> gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock </s>
<s> he was thinking of rittenhouse and how he had left him there to rock to death on the porch of the splendide </s>
<s> it was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt </s>
<s> beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps terrible to see </s>
<s> clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known </s>
<s> against that other man he could rally his anger </s>
<s> against this bent man in the chair he was powerless </s>
<s> he whispered </s>
<s> i believed him </s>
<s> they killed big charlie dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago </s>
<s> my men they all left me </s>
<s> just cleared out </s>
<s> they just all cleared out </s>
<s> he wiped his lips with a sleeve then stared at clayton in a childish kind of wonder </s>
<s> the old man beckoned with one finger and clayton went forward to him </s>
<s> gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely </s>
<s> i tried </s>
<s> and you wanted no part of me when i had so much to give </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> that would mock me too much </s>
<s> clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back </s>
<s> the eyes followed him fearfully </s>
<s> he burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air </s>
<s> when he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch </s>
<s> the stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf shaking his head </s>
<s> clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck </s>
<s> the mare had backed away </s>
<s> gavin stood on the porch a thin figure </s>
<s> he had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand the stock bumping on the wood floor </s>
<s> clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps </s>
<s> i have to think about it </s>
<s> gavin began to nod </s>
<s> a man could make a mark there </s>
<s> clayton lifted him gently into the saddle like a child </s>
<s> lived alone by the river </s>
<s> it was nice then so peaceful and quiet </s>
<s> there was no one but me </s>
<s> the two horses broke from the yard from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house into the darkness </s>
<s> thirty-five </s>
<s> they rode at a measured pace through the valley </s>
<s> dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest </s>
<s> the moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light looked primeval as if no man had ever trespassed before </s>
<s> gavin sighed bitterly </s>
<s> in that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind </s>
<s> he saw them ambushed strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying </s>
<s> in vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately but they would not come to life </s>
<s> they passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills </s>
<s> then at last the darkness began to dissolve </s>
<s> a bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky </s>
<s> the wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies </s>
<s> they had been seen as soon as they left the ranch picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees </s>
<s> the two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon crying their intelligence </s>
<s> but the liquor had flushed their courage </s>
<s> they greeted the news angrily as though they had been cheated of purpose </s>
<s> lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their desire </s>
<s> he worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat dry and cracked </s>
<s> clayton is with him takin him out of the valley </s>
<s> joe purvis was thinking back many years </s>
<s> first he thought of the time he had ridden to gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley </s>
<s> he treats her like she was dirt </s>
<s> it was the night clayton had tricked them in the poker game </s>
<s> he turned to lester </s>
<s> he meant to help gavin all the time </s>
<s> there are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place </s>
<s> the boy jerked away </s>
<s> cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night </s>
<s> he fled through the door and down the steps running and the men grunted and followed pushing lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light </s>
<s> purvis and silas pettigrew were the last to leave </s>
<s> they mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance </s>
<s> thirty-six </s>
<s> in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear </s>
<s> the clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow </s>
<s> when they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them strung out on the prairie in a flat black line </s>
<s> the wind of their running was cold and wild the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind </s>
<s> he looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers </s>
<s> they neither gained nor fell back </s>
<s> ahead of him gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the gap no more than a mile away </s>
<s> he did not look back </s>
<s> he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north </s>
<s> now they were riding to kill him </s>
<s> the land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in his valley </s>
<s> with every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his that he would never see again </s>
<s> california is too far he thought </s>
<s> he would never reach california </s>
<s> the sentry was not dead </s>
<s> he was in fact showing signs of reviving </s>
<s> he had been carrying an enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol </s>
<s> a bayonet hung in a belt scabbard </s>
<s> he was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat </s>
<s> mike stripped these from him and donned them </s>
<s> he and dean tied and gagged the man using his belt and shirt for the purpose </s>
<s> they dragged him inside the building </s>
<s> fiske joined them unsteady on his feet </s>
<s> julia seeing the bandage rushed to him </s>
<s> she breathed </s>
<s> he turned to susan and kissed her on the cheek </s>
<s> mike silenced them </s>
<s> mike debated it trying to decide whether fiske was strong enough to ride </s>
<s> but it at least offered him a chance for living </s>
<s> he had none here </s>
<s> and for the sake of julia and susan it had to be tried </s>
<s> the guerrilla bivouac remained silent </s>
<s> light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground </s>
<s> someone evidently was on duty there </s>
<s> no doubt there would be men guarding the horses </s>
<s> about a dozen animals were held inside the stockade as best mike could make out in the moonlight </s>
<s> evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency </s>
<s> you stay with the ladies </s>
<s> he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol </s>
<s> susan halted dean and kissed him </s>
<s> she clung to him talking to him and dabbing at her eyes </s>
<s> mike turned away </s>
<s> he felt unutterably weary </s>
<s> dean turned from susan and took julia fortune in his arms </s>
<s> he kissed her also and with deep tenderness </s>
<s> she too began to weep </s>
<s> he released her and joined mike </s>
<s> susan said fiercely </s>
<s> he snorted </s>
<s> he kept going </s>
<s> he wanted no more sentimental scenes with her </s>
<s> he might say or do something foolish </s>
<s> something all of them would regret </s>
<s> and using him mike mclish as a sop to her pride </s>
<s> he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol </s>
<s> holding the pistol concealed he walked to the rear wall of the stockade </s>
<s> it was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings </s>
<s> one wing stood open </s>
<s> mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses </s>
<s> they were tethered army style on stable lines </s>
<s> a voice spoke near-at-hand </s>
<s> he located his man </s>
<s> the guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight </s>
<s> mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol </s>
<s> but the luck that had been running their way left him </s>
<s> the guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle </s>
<s> mike off balance managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded </s>
<s> the bullet went wide </s>
<s> mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash </s>
<s> the explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills </s>
<s> the startled horses began rearing on their tethers </s>
<s> dean came rushing up </s>
<s> he demanded </s>
<s> mike said </s>
<s> he said </s>
<s> he protested </s>
<s> mike said frantically </s>
<s> try to find these feds </s>
<s> the rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back </s>
<s> dean still hesitated but mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand </s>
<s> watch out for apaches when it comes daylight </s>
<s> take the pistol </s>
<s> you might need it </s>
<s> dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back </s>
<s> then he was on his way at a gallop </s>
<s> mike ran down the line slashing picket ropes with the bayonet </s>
<s> he lifted a screeching war whoop </s>
<s> that touched off a total stampede </s>
<s> he darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there </s>
<s> these poured through the gate and joined the flight </s>
<s> the animals thundered away into the moonlight heading for the ridges </s>
<s> the guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure </s>
<s> mike yelled </s>
<s> he scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings </s>
<s> he crouched there </s>
<s> his shout had been taken up and repeated </s>
<s> the guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses </s>
<s> all were carrying guns they had seized up but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all </s>
<s> durkin and calhoun came running from the post </s>
<s> they had pistols in their hands </s>
<s> they bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar </s>
<s> they followed the others toward the east gate </s>
<s> beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were apaches </s>
<s> mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings </s>
<s> he crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner </s>
<s> the area was deserted </s>
<s> mike crawled to the door and peered in </s>
<s> the orderly room seemed to be deserted </s>
<s> a lantern hung from a peg giving light </s>
<s> ducking inside he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner </s>
<s> a brace of pistols holstered on belts hung from a peg along with ammunition pouches </s>
<s> an ammunition case stood open containing canisters which contained powder cartridges </s>
<s> mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty </s>
<s> shouldering the load he peered from the door </s>
<s> his looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas </s>
<s> he looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons struck by a new inspiration </s>
<s> he set his bundle down </s>
<s> snatching the lantern from its peg he shattered its globe with a blow against a post </s>
<s> he picked up the powder canister and ran out </s>
<s> bursting paper cartridges he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it </s>
<s> he shouldered the blanket again backed off and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon </s>
<s> he turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house </s>
<s> powder flame gushed beneath the wagon </s>
<s> the stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him </s>
<s> they realized the truth </s>
<s> bullets began to snap past him </s>
<s> one struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack </s>
<s> its force spun him around but he recovered and got into stride again </s>
<s> a bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety </s>
<s> another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down </s>
<s> guerrillas were racing toward him </s>
<s> susan and julia came from the door and dragged him with them </s>
<s> the three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap </s>
<s> susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door </s>
<s> she crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal chewing into the planks </s>
<s> some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak </s>
<s> the iron hinges held but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars </s>
<s> mike rolled to susan grasped her around the knees dragging her off her feet </s>
<s> he hovered over her to shield her for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls </s>
<s> he peered from a loophole </s>
<s> guerrillas were only a dozen yards away charging the house </s>
<s> mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired </s>
<s> he dropped a man with the first bullet </s>
<s> at the same moment wheeler fiske fired the rifle mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit </s>
<s> that halted the rush </s>
<s> the guerrillas scattered for cover </s>
<s> the wagons were burning fiercely </s>
<s> the mudwagon had caught fire also </s>
<s> the blaze was spreading to the frame buildings </s>
<s> the guerrillas realized they faced a new problem </s>
<s> one screeched </s>
<s> calhoun shouted </s>
<s> the guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring </s>
<s> but what few containers they found were inadequate </s>
<s> many of them in increasing panic came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort </s>
<s> both buildings were in flames </s>
<s> the heat drove the guerrillas back </s>
<s> the roof of the command post began to buckle </s>
<s> lew durkin yelled </s>
<s> one of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame </s>
<s> a sizable supply of powder had been touched off </s>
<s> the wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings </s>
<s> the bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor </s>
<s> but it had missed the bone and had passed on through </s>
<s> susan and julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury </s>
<s> mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it </s>
<s> here comes jason </s>
<s> reverend jason looking worried hurried toward us </s>
<s> he brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp </s>
<s> fort up </s>
<s> for a second engages cooks voyageurs appeared struck dumb </s>
<s> then little billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal </s>
<s> they all flew into action </s>
<s> the aricaras treated us like friends </s>
<s> and here all the time you knew the sioux would be using our rifles on them </s>
<s> oso gave me an unruffled look </s>
<s> he shook his head </s>
<s> then he went on to the cheyennes and told them that the sioux was goin to move up </s>
<s> he did that with all the nations </s>
<s> hell they were fightin each other so hard they had no time for anyone else </s>
<s> the war department wrote mr manuel a letter and said he was a hero </s>
<s> i saw that letter </s>
<s> first it was the nations against themselves then it was them against the whites </s>
<s> i remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight </s>
<s> once we get over the mountains others will come along </s>
<s> that bastard chambers </s>
<s> for unlike the sioux and the crows the aricaras are not great horsemen nor are they aggressive like the savage blackfeet </s>
<s> more of an agricultural nation they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains </s>
<s> surprisingly he had told the others what he had done </s>
<s> in the brief moment i had to talk to them before i took my post on the ring of defenses i indicated i was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river </s>
<s> reverend jason was understandably bitter </s>
<s> those little children </s>
<s> attack </s>
<s> gray eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky </s>
<s> our camp was in the center of a wide valley </s>
<s> montero had set up a strong position using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush </s>
<s> he had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire </s>
<s> the pony herd was the one flaw in our defense </s>
<s> the rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible </s>
<s> wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors </s>
<s> buckets were filled the herd fed and watered </s>
<s> the worst part had been the waiting </s>
<s> oso slept unconcernedly his rifle cradled in his arms </s>
<s> every time i closed my eyes i saw gray eyes rushing at me with a knife </s>
<s> it was a relief when they finally came </s>
<s> they poured through the opening in the valley then spread out in a long line to come at us brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry </s>
<s> i could see them in my sights </s>
<s> they were about a mile off </s>
<s> under me the ground quivered slightly </s>
<s> at first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies hunched over their horses heads </s>
<s> gradually they emerged as men </s>
<s> gray eyes was in the lead </s>
<s> his face was split by a vermilion streak his eyes were pools of white </s>
<s> jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest </s>
<s> he was naked except for a clout </s>
<s> next to him was a young boy i was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions </s>
<s> his mouth was open his neck corded with the strain of his screams </s>
<s> i found his chest in my sights </s>
<s> it had a red circle </s>
<s> the circle came nearer and nearer </s>
<s> my god how long is he going to wait i thought </s>
<s> at first i thought he had missed </s>
<s> gray eyes remained erect </s>
<s> the feathered lance was still above his head </s>
<s> as he started to slump over another warrior swung him onto his horse </s>
<s> i squeezed the trigger </s>
<s> at the last second i dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony </s>
<s> i saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head bouncing like a rubber ball </s>
<s> he jerked once in the grass and lay still </s>
<s> oso growled </s>
<s> what else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides </s>
<s> the aricaras broke under the devastating fire wheeled and retreated </s>
<s> lead up </s>
<s> montero was shouting </s>
<s> far up the valley i could see the rees circling and reorganizing </s>
<s> out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men war shields lances blankets and wounded and dead horses </s>
<s> the morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood the acrid stench of frightened horses and the bitterness of burned powder </s>
<s> a horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy </s>
<s> a rifle cracked </s>
<s> the square head fell over </s>
<s> one of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek </s>
<s> his legs pumped furiously his long black hair streamed out behind him </s>
<s> there was a ragged volley </s>
<s> he was dead before he hit the ground </s>
<s> montero shouted furiously </s>
<s> the sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint </s>
<s> they grew louder as the indians charged again </s>
<s> i could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease their mouths open shouting their spine-chilling cries </s>
<s> the war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat </s>
<s> i could see the blood running down his chest </s>
<s> he was riding between two warriors who held him erect when he started to slump </s>
<s> i forgot to aim </s>
<s> in my sights i watched him looming bigger and bigger </s>
<s> there was no doubt he was dying </s>
<s> again we waited for montero </s>
<s> this time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically but they held their fire </s>
<s> the horses were only several lengths away when he fired </s>
<s> the bullet flung gray eyes from his horse </s>
<s> our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts </s>
<s> but a few reached our wall </s>
<s> men screamed </s>
<s> oso reached up jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck </s>
<s> other indians were running at the ponies shrilling and waving blankets </s>
<s> reverend jason got one the canadians the others </s>
<s> i saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot then run back to his position </s>
<s> the ponies were almost uncontrollable </s>
<s> the pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again </s>
<s> this time more of them hurdled the barrier </s>
<s> a small indian dived at montero who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt </s>
<s> it sounded like a man kicking a melon </s>
<s> above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales </s>
<s> although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of me </s>
<s> i could smell woodsmoke grease and oil </s>
<s> his eyes were dark fluid fearful and he gave a sigh as my knife went in </s>
<s> coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil </s>
<s> now under me i could see him for what he really was a boy dressed up in streaks of paint </s>
<s> the aricaras made one last desperate charge </s>
<s> it was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors old and young wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam slam of the cruelly efficient hawkinses </s>
<s> others badly wounded gripped hands in manes knees in bellies held on as long as possible and then weak from ghastly wounds slipped sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be broken under the slashing hoofs </s>
<s> some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts </s>
<s> none of them reached our walls again </s>
<s> the few survivors grudgingly turned away </s>
<s> in the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song </s>
<s> she was carrying a quirt and she started to raise it then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist </s>
<s> he was losing patience again </s>
<s> an hour before with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness he would have appreciated company </s>
<s> she had helped him change his mind </s>
<s> let it burn down </s>
<s> he was taken aback </s>
<s> it took him a long time to compose himself </s>
<s> she showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face </s>
<s> she glanced around the clearing taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground the two kids the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight </s>
<s> she studied it for a long time </s>
<s> she said and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly </s>
<s> the girl laughed </s>
<s> i ought to </s>
<s> he stood watching the girl wondering what was coming next </s>
<s> she had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him </s>
<s> he sold me a clear title </s>
<s> i have it with me right here </s>
<s> i meant what i said about that fire </s>
<s> he took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly and it was his turn to smile now </s>
<s> it might hurt you though </s>
<s> he meant to say more but he never got the chance </s>
<s> she was quick </s>
<s> she brought the quirt down slashing it across his cheek and he tried to step back </s>
<s> she swung the quirt again and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle </s>
<s> she came down against him and he tried to break her fall </s>
<s> he grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him </s>
<s> it made him a little sick and he let go of her </s>
<s> he got up slowly and she was already on her feet and he stood facing her </s>
<s> he wiped the blood from his cheek </s>
<s> he was shaking with anger his breath coming in long painful gasps </s>
<s> the voice came from behind him and wilson turned </s>
<s> the fire had gone down and the man was only a shadow against the trees </s>
<s> but a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light and wilson had a good look at him </s>
<s> he was tall and dark-skinned a half-breed wilson thought </s>
<s> and he was handsome despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek </s>
<s> she seemed irritated </s>
<s> the half-breed eased the winchester down and rested it across his lap </s>
<s> the scar looked pure white in the half-darkness </s>
<s> his eyes were black and deep-set and expressionless </s>
<s> the girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him </s>
<s> he took it without flinching </s>
<s> but the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth and his eyes were hurt and angry </s>
<s> it made wilson wonder </s>
<s> he watched the half-breed as he turned silently </s>
<s> wilson brushed the dust from his coat </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> not yours </s>
<s> mine </s>
<s> she wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat </s>
<s> he saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt and he grabbed her wrist </s>
<s> you took me by surprise </s>
<s> she brought up her free hand to hit him but this time he was quicker </s>
<s> he side-stepped her blow and she fell stumbling against the gelding </s>
<s> she finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle </s>
<s> her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders held by the string and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before </s>
<s> he had forgotten that she was so pretty </s>
<s> but her prettiness was what he had noticed first and all the other things had come afterward cruelty meanness self-will </s>
<s> he had known women like that one woman in particular </s>
<s> and one had been too many </s>
<s> they expected greater things from him regardless of how trying the circumstances and they were disappointed </s>
<s> and determined not to show it </s>
<s> they lay a little too stiffly with their eyes straining to stay closed </s>
<s> he found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream </s>
<s> the coyote was calling again and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it </s>
<s> not tonight at any rate </s>
<s> he had a feeling that the girl meant trouble </s>
<s> if she did he could stand it better in the light </s>
<s> he scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out </s>
<s> that afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house his hopes had been high </s>
<s> not all of it </s>
<s> there would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief </s>
<s> but they were starting a new life </s>
<s> and they had almost everything they needed land a house two whiteface bulls three horses </s>
<s> six hundred and forty acres the old man back in st louis had said </s>
<s> good grass good water </s>
<s> well the grass was there though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it </s>
<s> the water was there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard </s>
<s> and there was a house </s>
<s> livable perhaps but badly in need of repairs </s>
<s> in the last analysis though wilson had little cause to complain </s>
<s> they had the house cleaned up by noon and wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses </s>
<s> he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness and finally went over to help him </s>
<s> kathy was already in the wagon </s>
<s> they were going to town and they were both excited </s>
<s> he had an uneasy feeling about it </s>
<s> judith pierce </s>
<s> it was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember </s>
<s> he finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him </s>
<s> he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than judith pierce had made it seem </s>
<s> but there was water </s>
<s> there was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard </s>
<s> yes there was plenty of water too much and that was probably the trouble </s>
<s> there were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres </s>
<s> the first part of the road was steep but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley </s>
<s> it was hotter once they reached the flat and drier but the grass was better </s>
<s> a warm breeze played across it moving it like waves </s>
<s> a red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road </s>
<s> it took them an hour before they came to the first houses of kelseyville </s>
<s> the town was about what wilson expected one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings a water tower a few warehouses a single hotel </s>
<s> all dusty and sunbaked </s>
<s> the place was quiet </s>
<s> such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility of this </s>
<s> under the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all </s>
<s> i was nearly thirty at the time </s>
<s> i went to the hall in the afternoons only on these preliminary matters </s>
<s> it was dark and i sensed very large </s>
<s> only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it </s>
<s> sometimes i was aware of people moving about in the darkness </s>
<s> i would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded </s>
<s> a glimpse of three of four vague figures at the most </s>
<s> drifting here and there </s>
<s> squatting as if waiting </s>
<s> the pulsing glow of a cigarette </s>
<s> since they could see me but i not them their presence in the hall disturbed me </s>
<s> the clerk paid them no attention </s>
<s> this impressed me until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence </s>
<s> his job simply consisted in registering new men </s>
<s> when the phone rang he answered it </s>
<s> his authority extended to the far edge of the counter no further </s>
<s> none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him </s>
<s> baldness was attacking his pate </s>
<s> he spoke to me in a gruff voice an affectation which quite belied his personality </s>
<s> he wore his white shirt open at the neck revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath </s>
<s> it was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was </s>
<s> but it was not easy for him and he often slipped </s>
<s> when one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle i noticed how the clerk winced </s>
<s> i felt certain he was really a spineless little man </s>
<s> on a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music </s>
<s> everything about the clerk was trivial </s>
<s> once pressing him i learned that his job was only part-time in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall </s>
<s> noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person </s>
<s> with distaste i saw him assume a pompous air </s>
<s> when he saw me coming he turned his radio off </s>
<s> he made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf </s>
<s> he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence then bark into it with gruff importance </s>
<s> what limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me </s>
<s> in the mornings i was informed fluorescent tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire hall </s>
<s> they and the two large fans which i could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office </s>
<s> he pointed out the switch to me and for a moment i foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words </s>
<s> i was shown instead a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning </s>
<s> now here was something of obvious importance to me yet when i reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand </s>
<s> each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient </s>
<s> i withdrew my hand </s>
<s> later i would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket </s>
<s> having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed i gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself </s>
<s> the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air </s>
<s> one afternoon upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk i had visited the toilet adjoining the hall </s>
<s> by counting the number of stalls and urinals i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time </s>
<s> for although i had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended </s>
<s> i could observe the two fans down at the end but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as i had no measure of comparison </s>
<s> i had for some time been hoping in vain for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself </s>
<s> i knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall but what they were doing and exactly where i could not tell </s>
<s> it was i felt possible that they were men who having received no tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light </s>
<s> this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying or squatting on the floor below </s>
<s> also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder </s>
<s> no sooner would i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at times quite sharply in order to bring back my attention </s>
<s> and i had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office flicked off and on impatiently </s>
<s> this sort of petty vigilance annoyed me </s>
<s> i felt certain it was self-appointed </s>
<s> i decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed </s>
<s> i felt strongly attached to the hall however and hardly a day passed when i did not go to look at it from a distance </s>
<s> i lived in a state of suspense because of it </s>
<s> i could not cling to my past nor did i wish to </s>
<s> i had signed it off on the forms </s>
<s> although i had been inside it i had not yet seen it functioning </s>
<s> i wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to be wearing </s>
<s> i did not despair however </s>
<s> far from it </s>
<s> i was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall </s>
<s> though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town its character was wholly foreign to me </s>
<s> large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall fronted </s>
<s> the river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it </s>
<s> sometimes i noticed the tops of ships masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs </s>
<s> the hall on the other hand appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons </s>
<s> its front was windowless but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows now blinded had once looked out upon the street </s>
<s> i kept circling the block hoping to see from the street behind it the rear of the hall </s>
<s> but it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it </s>
<s> i returned to the hall despite my dislike for the clerk </s>
<s> as i had expected he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application </s>
<s> meanwhile spring had passed well into summer </s>
<s> at last when i put it to him directly the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual </s>
<s> when i asked him what if anything i could do about it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall </s>
<s> when i went for my interview with the director i saw why </s>
<s> although it was dark as usual i could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people </s>
<s> cigarette butts littered the floor </s>
<s> the big fans were going drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling </s>
<s> i had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs </s>
<s> the staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men </s>
<s> i stopped by the counter </s>
<s> no one was behind it but in the rear wall of the office i noticed for the first time a door which had been left partially open </s>
<s> past it i could see part part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on the floor </s>
<s> i rapped my knuckles on the counter </s>
<s> the director came to the door </s>
<s> i was at once disappointed although just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained </s>
<s> he was a man in his late forties with graying hair of medium height </s>
<s> he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar </s>
<s> he wore perforated white-topped shoes </s>
<s> they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment </s>
<s> but he came toward me sedately enough showed me around the counter offered me a seat inside his office then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application </s>
<s> i had the impression that he had read my forms perhaps several times </s>
<s> he did not look at them now </s>
<s> as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall </s>
<s> he spoke in a voice as immaculate as his appearance </s>
<s> begging my pardon he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall </s>
<s> he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there </s>
<s> indeed my scholastic qualifications were such that he a college graduate himself must envy me them </s>
<s> these questions did not surprise me </s>
<s> i felt certain that the director like the afternoon clerk seldom moved beyond the counter that the hall to them was a jungle a dark and unwelcome place </s>
<s> though i doubted that he would understand me i told the director my motives for applying </s>
<s> i had always i said hankered after working hard with my hands </s>
<s> this desire i went on growing voluble as my conviction was aroused had mounted at such a rate recently that i now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing </s>
<s> to this effect i had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence </s>
<s> the flat hard cap was small but he thrust it to the back of his head </s>
<s> the man went over without sound falling to the bare floor </s>
<s> rankin sneered at him </s>
<s> the only reason we brought you was to get miller out </s>
<s> fred rankin looked at him </s>
<s> it seemed to barton that the green eyes mocked him the thin-lipped smile held insolence but he had no time to waste now </s>
<s> they filed out through the guard-room door into the paved square </s>
<s> there were three other men within this prison whom barton would have liked to liberate but they were in other cell blocks </s>
<s> there was no chance </s>
<s> they moved slowly toward the main gate following the wall </s>
<s> there was no moon </s>
<s> they had chosen this night purposely </s>
<s> they reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above and powers slipped through the door </s>
<s> two men were on duty inside playing pinochle relaxed </s>
<s> they looked up in surprise as powers came in </s>
<s> they stared at him </s>
<s> the sergeant in charge climbed to his feet </s>
<s> the sergeant turned to the door </s>
<s> the sergeant froze </s>
<s> powers had not followed </s>
<s> powers was covering the remaining guard </s>
<s> the man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell </s>
<s> powers knocked his arm aside </s>
<s> they were free </s>
<s> even barton could not quite believe it </s>
<s> it had gone without a hitch </s>
<s> they slid through the wicket in the big gate ghosted across the dark ground </s>
<s> five minutes later they reached the horses </s>
<s> barton was relieved to see that carl dill and emmett foster had brought extra mounts </s>
<s> he had been worried that with miller and rankin added to the escape party they would be short </s>
<s> no one hurried </s>
<s> they walked the horses heading along the river barton and emmett foster in the lead seven men riding quietly through the night </s>
<s> the only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards three the striped suits of convicts </s>
<s> five miles </s>
<s> in a small grove against the river they halted turning deep into the protection of the trees </s>
<s> foster had brought extra clothing also </s>
<s> a good man emmett </s>
<s> he had been one of the original night riders one who had escaped the trial </s>
<s> clyde miller was crying softly to himself shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants the worn brown shirt </s>
<s> kid boyd was unusually silent rankin watchful a few paces apart </s>
<s> barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to powers </s>
<s> the ex-prison guard was embarrassed </s>
<s> i did it for the valley </s>
<s> barton turned away his eyes falling upon rankin beside his horse </s>
<s> the murderer lifted his head </s>
<s> barton hesitated </s>
<s> he did not trust rankin his violent temper his killer instinct </s>
<s> but ten years in prison had taught him realities </s>
<s> they were in a fight outweighed in both numbers and money </s>
<s> it was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses to call them night riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure </s>
<s> but if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals men who knew how to use a gun against men who would match the killers on the other side </s>
<s> he wanted a careful uninterrupted report from dill on the conditions in the valley </s>
<s> they squatted on their heels in the deep mud and dill found a cigar in his breast pocket passing it over silently </s>
<s> he too knew the agony of going for weeks sometimes months without the solace of tobacco </s>
<s> mitchell barton drew in the fragrance deeply letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled </s>
<s> through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly </s>
<s> for his first five years in prison they had shared a cell </s>
<s> carl dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man </s>
<s> he had done time for the theft </s>
<s> the one thing they had in common was their hatred </s>
<s> both hated donald kruger </s>
<s> mitch barton knew the place </s>
<s> twenty years before a group of easterners had bought out the haskell claims in the rocky hills south of grass valley </s>
<s> they had spent a million dollars carving in a road putting up buildings drilling their haulage tunnel </s>
<s> then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned </s>
<s> barton nodded </s>
<s> barton waited for a long moment then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind </s>
<s> dill was silent as if he hated to answer and barton had a cold sick feeling of apprehension </s>
<s> barton half-straightened in surprise </s>
<s> again dill hesitated </s>
<s> barton cursed under his breath </s>
<s> your cousin finley saw to that </s>
<s> barton stood up </s>
<s> dill had come up also </s>
<s> i understand how you feel about the child </s>
<s> my wife died in childbirth after i was sent away </s>
<s> chapter two </s>
<s> it was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state </s>
<s> it reached donald kruger in his massive home in burlingame </s>
<s> it reached the mines at north san juan and bloomfield </s>
<s> it brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences </s>
<s> for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg and mitchell barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence </s>
<s> creighton hague sat in his office above the ione pit </s>
<s> the office was of logs four rooms each heated by an iron stove </s>
<s> the building was dwarfed by the scene outside </s>
<s> there a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside </s>
<s> the gravel was the bed of an ancient river buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth </s>
<s> it was partially cemented by ages and pressure yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams the force of a thousand fire hoses and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices </s>
<s> a million dollars of gold a month </s>
<s> a million tons of rock and soil and brush </s>
<s> the monitors ran twenty-four hours each day </s>
<s> their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles </s>
<s> hague like all who worked near the pits was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums </s>
<s> he was a big man wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air </s>
<s> fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt </s>
<s> ten years older than mitch barton he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation </s>
<s> he was proud of his accomplishments proud of his job proud that donald kruger and his associates trusted him </s>
<s> he lived and breathed for the mining company </s>
<s> no man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless and hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life </s>
<s> there came a ghost of noise at the office door and hague swung to see kodyke in the entrance from the outer room </s>
<s> hague had never accustomed himself to kodyke </s>
<s> the man was tall thin with a narrow face and a too-large nose </s>
<s> even hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was kodyke </s>
<s> kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from kruger </s>
<s> kodyke was to head the dread company police </s>
<s> he ran the change rooms </s>
<s> he threw out the hi-graders </s>
<s> he supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to san francisco </s>
<s> hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike </s>
<s> he pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype </s>
<s> he broke out of folsom last night </s>
<s> apparently he bribed one of the guards </s>
<s> kodyke took the picture in a lean hand studying it thoughtfully </s>
<s> you know how the ranchers in the valley are </s>
<s> they blame us for all their troubles </s>
<s> ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches </s>
<s> it cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them </s>
<s> the gunman nodded slipping the picture into his breast pocket saying nothing </s>
<s> normally hague wasted no words but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew kodyke was aware of all he said </s>
<s> if she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother she did not comment upon it </s>
<s> then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill with the village as her ostensible destination </s>
<s> as she drove she thought about her plan </s>
<s> it was really quite simple </s>
<s> that mistake she thought had cost her dearly these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her </s>
<s> she must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest </s>
<s> when the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the culver house pamela turned the wheel guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house and stopped </s>
<s> all of her movements were careful and methodical partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime </s>
<s> she locked the ignition removed the keys stepped out of the car and went into the house </s>
<s> here she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom </s>
<s> if she pamela were being held responsible for his crimes then hers must be the final act of expiation </s>
<s> she would return this symbol to the mountain as one pours seed back into the soil every spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice </s>
<s> slowly and thoughtfully she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks moved down the stairs and out of the house </s>
<s> atonement if atonement were possible could only be made at that sacred sacrificial basin </s>
<s> it was there that she would have to enact her renunciation beg forgiveness </s>
<s> perhaps it was insane pamela thought </s>
<s> perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream </s>
<s> but she was caught in it and she faced the terrible possibility that if it were a dream it was one from which she might never awaken </s>
<s> facing the forest now she who had not dared to enter it before walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool </s>
<s> she remembered little of her previous journey there with grace and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it </s>
<s> the forest was open and freely welcoming extending an enchanted hand </s>
<s> the ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle </s>
<s> birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun all dewy-eyed and soft caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time </s>
<s> it was not thought pamela such an evil place after all </s>
<s> no wonder melissa responded so completely to its beckoning </s>
<s> perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed </s>
<s> pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along </s>
<s> the slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear </s>
<s> she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants </s>
<s> having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them </s>
<s> a few days ago she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous </s>
<s> today on the contrary it seemed utterly reasonable </s>
<s> she did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail </s>
<s> she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal </s>
<s> if as she walked her steps fumbled from time to time she chose to ignore that omen </s>
<s> if the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim she tried not to heed </s>
<s> success depended upon maintaining her equanimity </s>
<s> she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest </s>
<s> the forest took on an impersonal aspect </s>
<s> it did not care what sort of person prowled its woods plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes </s>
<s> knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man </s>
<s> pamela shook her head </s>
<s> she must not think about time </s>
<s> that was another one of those traps </s>
<s> in her grim pursuit of tranquillity pamela focused her thoughts on her husband </s>
<s> if when this was all over she found the words to tell him about it she wondered if he would ever understand </s>
<s> indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor </s>
<s> his bright daylight mind would whistle away such images </s>
<s> they would not dare to face his scoffing </s>
<s> pamela was glad jim was nowhere near </s>
<s> his presence would have interfered with her duty </s>
<s> the mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles </s>
<s> the trees huddled more closely together their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun </s>
<s> bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass pamela could no longer be positive of her direction </s>
<s> nevertheless she continued to move upward </s>
<s> she was sure she would reach the pool by climbing and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles </s>
<s> the forest had become an alien world where she strove alone unprotected unguided to deal with whatever hindrances were offered </s>
<s> it was a bold dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress eclipsing the sun and human time </s>
<s> at one and the same time she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry </s>
<s> silence stood in front of her waiting and in back of her blocking her retreat </s>
<s> she stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth </s>
<s> in spite of her attempt to preserve her balance she fell bruising her arm on a naked stone </s>
<s> for a moment she could not catch her breath and then her breath returning in short frightened spasms she lifted herself to her feet laboriously </s>
<s> she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes </s>
<s> her arm bled slightly and the offended skin cried out in pain </s>
<s> she looked around </s>
<s> she was bewildered </s>
<s> she stood quite still trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn a path to follow a clue to guide her </s>
<s> she was standing in a thick grove </s>
<s> the trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped virtually shutting out the sun completely </s>
<s> she had the feeling that under the mouldering leaves there would be the bodies of dead animals quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain </s>
<s> the thought made pamela shudder </s>
<s> a terrible chill swept through the grove </s>
<s> not a breeze exactly but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove catching pamela in a leering embrace </s>
<s> there was a peculiar density about it a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified never actually perceived </s>
<s> she already knew this unwholesome chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive </s>
<s> it enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles </s>
<s> it crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin </s>
<s> it crawled across her breasts suffocating the life in her nipples </s>
<s> it circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles </s>
<s> it entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus and its particles spreading creeping crawling joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached </s>
<s> stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps </s>
<s> clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws </s>
<s> she had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain depriving her of reason and sight </s>
<s> but she did not know which way to go </s>
<s> the shadows of the trees engulfed her foreclosing every possible exit from the grove </s>
<s> she had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles </s>
<s> pamela groped blindly </s>
<s> she had to escape </s>
<s> she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back </s>
<s> her own body protested aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed </s>
<s> every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy </s>
<s> twigs cracked loudly under her feet </s>
<s> bushes swished and scratched at her slacks </s>
<s> tree branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her </s>
<s> miraculously she found exactly the right statement </s>
<s> she began it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him </s>
<s> beaming idiotically he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her </s>
<s> she yanked away from him furiously </s>
<s> shu-tt up-pp </s>
<s> lord nodded agreeably </s>
<s> he said he wanted very much to listen </s>
<s> said joyce </s>
<s> he opened the door and got out </s>
<s> he waited at the car side for a moment looking down at her expectantly </s>
<s> he grinned nodded and walked around to the front of the car </s>
<s> lips pursed mournfully he stared down at its crazily sagging left side </s>
<s> then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots peered into the orderly chaos of axle shock absorber and spring </s>
<s> he went prone on his stomach the better to pursue his examination </s>
<s> after a time he straightened again brushing the red permian dust from his hands slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored twenty-five-dollar shirt </s>
<s> and he really feels that way she thought </s>
<s> just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package </s>
<s> if i could make myself feel the same way </s>
<s> she studied him hopefully yearningly </s>
<s> against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis </s>
<s> here in the god-forsaken place the westerly end of nowhere tom lord looked almost insignificant almost contemptible </s>
<s> he was handsome with his coal-black hair and eyes his fine-chiseled features </s>
<s> rather on the medium side </s>
<s> neither was he very powerful of build </s>
<s> and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance </s>
<s> just nothing she told herself </s>
<s> just so darned sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on everyone </s>
<s> he caught her eye came back around the car with the boot-wearer </s>
<s> teetering half-mincing walk </s>
<s> he slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely proffered one to her </s>
<s> she snapped </s>
<s> lord laughed with secret amusement </s>
<s> he pointed cutting her off </s>
<s> and even with her limited knowledge of such things she knew that the car could be repaired there </s>
<s> sufficiently at least to get them back into town </s>
<s> a wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency </s>
<s> he had to depend on himself since he was invariably miles and hours away from others </s>
<s> she looked at him lips compressed </s>
<s> then with a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up </s>
<s> in his mood it was the best way to handle him </s>
<s> that is to show no curiosity whatsoever </s>
<s> lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel </s>
<s> he seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned </s>
<s> along with this self-satisfaction however joyce sensed a growing tension </s>
<s> it poured out of him like an electric current a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action and that that action would be all that he anticipated </s>
<s> tom had been laying for aaron mcbride for a long time just waiting to catch him out of line </s>
<s> mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip </s>
<s> he had a legitimate reason for wearing it </s>
<s> it was payday for highlands and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields </s>
<s> he demanded when lord confronted him </s>
<s> it was the wrong thing to say </s>
<s> the trouble was that he had virtually had to protest </s>
<s> the deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him </s>
<s> he said </s>
<s> mcbride reddened </s>
<s> he himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company but that had nothing to do with him </s>
<s> he was an honest man doing a hard job and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable </s>
<s> so you get rid of that pistol right now mis-ter mcbride </s>
<s> not immediately as the deputy demanded </s>
<s> not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes </s>
<s> to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible </s>
<s> oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot </s>
<s> it was practically the last move that mcbride made of his own volition </s>
<s> lord slugged him in the stomach so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine </s>
<s> then as he doubled gasping vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten lord straightened him with an uppercut </s>
<s> a rabbit punch redoubled him </s>
<s> and then there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach </s>
<s> no more could he defend himself against them </s>
<s> he seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen </s>
<s> and he could no longer think of face-saving of honor but only of escape </s>
<s> i meant him no harm </s>
<s> beat me to death in front of a hundred people </s>
<s> somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for it the murder would go unpunished </s>
<s> he mcbride would be cited as in the wrong and he lord would go scot-free an officer who had only done his duty though perhaps too energetically </s>
<s> mcbride staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the stinging dust </s>
<s> fear-maddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled to his feet again </s>
<s> he was long past the point of coherent thinking </s>
<s> dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but he could not read the racket properly </s>
<s> he could not grasp that lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air </s>
<s> this he was sure was the way they would act </s>
<s> laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death </s>
<s> and nothing would be done about it </s>
<s> nothing unless </s>
<s> donna </s>

<s> conchita nagged at the younger children attempting without success to keep her thoughts off tom brannon </s>
<s> tom brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the maguires joined it which had been at midday </s>
<s> she wondered what had taken place in town between him and his wife </s>
<s> she wished that she could talk to her mother about it </s>

<s> at the moment the three men were not saying much of anything </s>

<s> brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel with the other two facing him </s>
<s> he held a cigarette in his right hand </s>
<s> it was burning away forgotten </s>
<s> his face was clouded with unhappiness </s>
<s> they were considering it gravely neither seeming to like what he planned </s>

<s> brannon shook his head </s>
<s> they were silent for a little while each looking glum </s>
<s> brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall </s>
<s> they had for cover both darkness and a summer storm </s>
<s> during much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east </s>

<s> they were all good men </s>
<s> it was dark early because of the storm </s>

<s> lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour </s>
<s> a lamp burned inside but brannon peering through the window saw that the office was empty </s>
<s> red come along </s>
<s> with red hogan he rode to the welcome cafe </s>
<s> hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside </s>
<s> they rode to the rockfork house a little farther along the opposite side of the street </s>
<s> they reined in there brannon remaining in the saddle while hogan went to look for jesse macklin in the hotel dining room </s>
<s> brannon had no slicker </s>
<s> but he felt no physical discomfort </s>
<s> he was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain </s>
<s> he hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder </s>
<s> hogan reappeared stopped on the hotel porch lifted a hand in signal </s>

<s> they closed in fast kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun </s>
<s> they escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office </s>

<s> they moved in on him crowded him from all sides </s>
<s> no man laid a hand on him but the threat of violence was there </s>
<s> his face took on a sudden pallor became beaded with sweat and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing </s>
<s> he held out a moment longer then his nerve gave under the pressure </s>
<s> resignedly macklin turned to the back door </s>
<s> they followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear </s>
<s> the door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron </s>

<s> deputy marshal luke harper still stood guard on the veranda a forlorn scarecrowish figure in the murky dark </s>
<s> he came to the edge of the veranda peered down at them with his hand on his gun </s>
<s> he strode past the now frightened man entered the house </s>
<s> miguel and arturo ramirez remained on the veranda to keep harper from interfering </s>
<s> the others followed brannon inside </s>
<s> they trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house </s>
<s> they brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves that of their own sweat of campfire smoke of horses and cattle </s>
<s> they tracked mud on the oaken floor on the carpet </s>
<s> their presence fouled the elegance of that room </s>
<s> and their arrival caught john clayton and charles ansley off guard </s>
<s> the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing </s>
<s> for men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second </s>
<s> but the day of the deadline came and passed and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction </s>
<s> for with a single exception nothing had happened to them </s>
<s> the exception was an iron mountain settler named william lewis </s>
<s> a split second later the distant crack of a rifle had sounded </s>
<s> but he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted </s>
<s> there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near </s>
<s> lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing </s>
<s> his land had never been plowed </s>
<s> he had done his rustling openly and boasted about it </s>
<s> he had received both first and second anonymous notices and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them </s>
<s> he had cursed at them and threatened them </s>
<s> william lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again that august morning after a bullet landed at his feet and once more he accused and threatened everyone </s>
<s> he raged </s>
<s> he had his chance the very next morning for exactly the same thing happened again </s>
<s> this time lewis had his own rifle in his hands and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot then spent most of the day searching out the area </s>
<s> he found nothing but he still refused to give up and move out </s>
<s> he exploded </s>
<s> he never got that chance </s>
<s> for the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time </s>
<s> a bullet smashed directly into the center of william lewis chest </s>
<s> he slumped against a log fence rail then tried to lift himself </s>
<s> two more shots followed in quick succession dropping him limp and huddled on the ground </s>
<s> rumors of the offer tom horn had made at the stockgrowers association meeting had leaked out by then and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway the prosecuting attorney a colonel baird ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning </s>
<s> it took some time to locate horn </s>
<s> he was finally found in the bates hole region of natrona county two counties away </s>
<s> prosecutor baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment </s>
<s> but that indictment was never made </s>
<s> for tom horn it turned out had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in bates hole the day of the killing </s>
<s> the authorities had to release him </s>
<s> he immediately rode on to cheyenne threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends </s>
<s> publicly he denied everything </s>
<s> privately he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin </s>
<s> a good many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of william lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats </s>
<s> the company herds were being raided less often and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted </s>
<s> but there were other homesteaders who passed the lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing the work of one of his neighbors </s>
<s> the rustling problem was by no means solved </s>
<s> even in the very area where the shooting had been done cattle were still disappearing </s>
<s> haying time was close at hand and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack </s>
<s> harnessing a team to a buckboard they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off then climbed down and began chopping </s>
<s> andy ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded </s>
<s> he looked around in surprise then noticed that fred powell was clutching his chest </s>
<s> the hired man ran over to help his boss </s>
<s> powell gasped </s>
<s> and he collapsed and died instantly </s>
<s> ross had no intention of searching for the assassin </s>
<s> he heaved the dead man onto the buckboard yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast </s>
<s> but he brought back the sheriff and several deputies and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the lewis killing </s>
<s> there were no tracks of either hoofs or boots </s>
<s> not even an empty cartridge case could be found </s>
<s> once again tom horn was the first and most likely suspect and he was brought in for questioning immediately </s>
<s> once again he shook his head kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm and had a strongly supported alibi ready </s>
<s> later riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of cheyenne he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made </s>
<s> he had lots of friends then as always </s>
<s> even as he became widely known as a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend </s>
<s> the tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement </s>
<s> he echoed again in soft wonder </s>
<s> after the first two murders the warning notes were rarely ignored </s>
<s> the lesson had been learned </s>
<s> the examples were plain </s>
<s> this was the message found tacked to the cabin door </s>
<s> keane left within three days </s>
<s> all through albany and laramie counties other men were doing the same </s>
<s> no cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer </s>
<s> jury judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long outdated </s>
<s> it is possible although highly doubtful that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state </s>
<s> it is also possible but equally doubtful that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him </s>
<s> the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the upper laramie country in a single week </s>
<s> he had made himself the personification of the devil to the homesteaders </s>
<s> but to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure </s>
<s> such ranchers as coble and clay and the bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown </s>
<s> he made their spreads his headquarters and he helped out in their roundups </s>
<s> in the cow camps tom horn was regarded as a hero as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos </s>
<s> the hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life </s>
<s> the wailing guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him </s>
<s> he moistened his lips uneasily </s>
<s> brenner shrugged carelessly </s>
<s> i just want you to take a message to diane molinari </s>
<s> vastly relieved summers nodded and started toward the door </s>
<s> summers pulled up short and turned around </s>
<s> brenner continued to smile but his eyes were cold </s>
<s> his face pale summers headed for the street </s>
<s> a man like jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed </s>
<s> probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding </s>
<s> curt approached the place cautiously and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees </s>
<s> curt circled the house and located a barn out back </s>
<s> he could hear horses moving around inside and nothing else </s>
<s> there was no lock on the door only an iron hook which he unfastened </s>
<s> he opened the door and went in pulling it shut behind him </s>
<s> again he stood in the darkness listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor </s>
<s> he moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him and came to a wooden partition </s>
<s> horse smell was very strong and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws </s>
<s> he found a match in his pocket and lit it </s>
<s> curt snuffed out the match </s>
<s> it was certain now that jess was in the house but also presumably was stacey black </s>
<s> curt wanted to get jess alone without interference from anyone even as spineless a person as the store owner </s>
<s> he studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved </s>
<s> reaching across the side of the stall he slapped the buckskin on the rump </s>
<s> the startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall </s>
<s> as curt had hoped the house door banged open </s>
<s> he slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly its hoofs rattling the side of the stall </s>
<s> curt moved over beside the door and waited </s>
<s> the horse continued to snort </s>
<s> jess cursed again and entered the barn </s>
<s> a match flared and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop </s>
<s> as he crossed to the side of the stall curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer </s>
<s> jess caught his breath in surprise </s>
<s> he started to reach for his gun but apparently thought better of it </s>
<s> he reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt </s>
<s> jess turned </s>
<s> there was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his neck were swollen </s>
<s> jess stiffened </s>
<s> now start talking </s>
<s> apparently sensing this and realizing that it gave him an advantage jess became bold </s>
<s> he retreated a step and holstered his own </s>
<s> curt angry enough to be a little reckless raised his hands shoulder high </s>
<s> jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides </s>
<s> somewhere in the distance a woman screamed </s>
<s> curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention </s>
<s> he had to make jess talk and he had to do it before stacey black got curious and came to investigate </s>
<s> he dropped his own beside it </s>
<s> with a roar of pain and fury jess made his attack </s>
<s> it was like hitting a sack of salt </s>
<s> he slammed into the wall bounced back and caught curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning </s>
<s> an inch lower and it would have knocked him out </s>
<s> as it was his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move </s>
<s> when his eyes began to focus he saw jess charging at him with a pitchfork </s>
<s> curt twisted to one side and the tines of the fork bit into the floor </s>
<s> jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose </s>
<s> it gave curt time to stagger to his feet </s>
<s> his aim was hurried </s>
<s> by now curt was seeing clearly again </s>
<s> they made jess double over </s>
<s> when his head came down curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall </s>
<s> the building shook setting the lantern to swaying and the buckskin to pitching again </s>
<s> he lurched drunkenly to his feet lowered his head and took one step away from the wall </s>
<s> curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor </s>
<s> jess had had enough </s>
<s> he let go of the shirt and jess slumped to the floor </s>
<s> the buckskin bolted out of the stall </s>
<s> curt moved in and picked up his gun </s>
<s> he shook loose straw out of the action and placed the gun in his holster </s>
<s> jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door </s>
<s> black called fearfully </s>
<s> curt opened the door grabbed black by the shoulder and pulled him into the barn </s>
<s> this dirty coward just admitted killing arbuckle </s>
<s> he shoved black toward the stall and pointed his pistol at jess </s>
<s> jess stumbled through the door </s>
<s> curt followed reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it </s>
<s> black would have little trouble getting out but it might delay him a few minutes </s>
<s> jess asked worriedly </s>
<s> what a spectacle he was caked with dirt and sweat and blood filthy as a pig and naked as an indian kissing the finest the sweetest the bravest and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world </s>
<s> he released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with old hap </s>
<s> dan could hear clayton burnside and eben jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen </s>
<s> jackson was doing most of the talking </s>
<s> there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening </s>
<s> damn it he thought bitterly picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve </s>
<s> he stooped picked up his ruined hat and pursed his lips thoughtfully </s>
<s> from the way the wound in his head was itching dan knew that it would heal </s>
<s> but his only hat was something else again </s>
<s> he shouted </s>
<s> the burnsides now ready to roll were purposefully deaf to his cry </s>
<s> he bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him </s>
<s> nate turned his head attempting to speak in a soothing voice </s>
<s> dan affirmed feeling ten feet tall </s>
<s> sally left her choring to stand beside dan </s>
<s> slipping her hand in his they silently watched the burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight </s>
<s> at first matilda could not believe her own eyes </s>
<s> she had spent too many hours looking ahead hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of dan and finding nothing but emptiness </s>
<s> and now she could see him looking uncommon handsome standing there beside sally jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon </s>
<s> seeing them waiting there at the foot of emigrant rock was so overwhelming that for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them matilda could not speak at all </s>
<s> pa </s>
<s> i can see dan </s>
<s> she replied </s>
<s> by then hez could see for himself and so could the others </s>
<s> soon they were all shouting greetings exchanging smiles and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again </s>
<s> but even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day </s>
<s> nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle tended the cattle tethered the horses gathered fuel carried water and started their cooking fires </s>
<s> then and only then with the jacksons and dan as their true guests of honor did the harrows take time to catch up on the news </s>
<s> the wound in his scalp was examined pronounced healing and well doctored with simples before they dished up the victuals </s>
<s> from then on in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood the whole group settled down to relish their food </s>
<s> only they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the virginia reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration </s>
<s> rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied </s>
<s> he looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers </s>
<s> with rod on his way and matilda visiting with mrs jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs and worried about all that might have happened to sally </s>
<s> she was glad completely and unselfishly glad to see that things were working out the right way for both sally and dan </s>
<s> not with the memory of her folks and the lost conestoga still holding her close </s>
<s> soon the child the dog the cat and even the cheese all joined them out there in the circle </s>
<s> by now harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them </s>
<s> no matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey each one exerted its own appeal </s>
<s> even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness </s>
<s> already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains </s>
<s> soon she saw rod and hez moving over to join them </s>
<s> no sooner were they through and the guards posted than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep </s>
<s> for matilda it was the first she had known in many a night </s>
<s> even the knowledge that she was losing another boy as a mother always does when a marriage is made did not prevent her from having the first carefree dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into bear valley way way back there when they were crossing those other mountains </s>
<s> next morning they moved on again </s>
<s> gran harrow exclaimed watching their rippling muscles as rod and dan swung her up into the load </s>
<s> rod and dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins </s>
<s> the two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed gran her cold snack and water jug placed the chamber pot beside her feet and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with alice </s>
<s> dan asked hez who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends </s>
<s> the three men stepped out to the side to wait for captain clemens signal </s>
<s> dan grinned and changed the subject </s>
<s> captain clemens signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams </s>
<s> rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing precipice-walled gorge </s>
<s> while no larger than dutch springs this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous </s>
<s> men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about </s>
<s> although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them </s>
<s> there were no less than six or seven saloons in ganado not counting the lower class dives all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters </s>
<s> pat only nodded </s>
<s> separating they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars </s>
<s> russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero </s>
<s> suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate gyp carmer so casually even were he to prove the thief </s>
<s> he tramped out of the miners rest with his hopes plummeting and headed doggedly for the palace saloon the last place of any consequence on this side of the street </s>
<s> the palace was an elaborate establishment built practically on stilts in front with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch </s>
<s> russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch </s>
<s> the front windows of the place were long and narrow reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior </s>
<s> heading for the batwings cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window and suddenly dodged aside </s>
<s> nerves tight as a bowstring he paused to gather his wits </s>
<s> against all expectation carmer was inside clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him </s>
<s> fierce anger surged through russ </s>
<s> he fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot </s>
<s> reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows he feverishly scanned the busy street below </s>
<s> stevens was nowhere in sight </s>
<s> muffling an exclamation russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down </s>
<s> as luck had it he had not gone twenty feet in the street before pat appeared </s>
<s> he said swiftly </s>
<s> russ pointed upward </s>
<s> hitching his cartridge belt around pat glanced upward briefly at the palace and started that way with cobb at his side </s>
<s> climbing the steps steadily they reached the top and headed for the door </s>
<s> pat pushed through first </s>
<s> forced behind him momentarily russ followed at once and halted two steps inside </s>
<s> his eyes widened </s>
<s> while five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry with gyp carmer a prominent figure it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday </s>
<s> carmer himself was nowhere to be seen </s>
<s> a man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track and another dozed at one of the card tables </s>
<s> two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar while the sleek-headed bartender absently polished a glass </s>
<s> looking the setup over stevens started coolly for the rear of the place </s>
<s> it was the barkeep </s>
<s> halting pat turned to survey him deliberately </s>
<s> he did not reply going on toward the back </s>
<s> less assured than the tall wide-shouldered man in the lead cobb followed alertly a hand on his gun butt </s>
<s> the bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it </s>
<s> he said no more </s>
<s> a hall opened in back of the bar running toward an ell </s>
<s> pat moved into it </s>
<s> small rooms probably for cards opened off on either side </s>
<s> all the doors were open at this hour except one and it was toward this that stevens made his way with russ close at his shoulder </s>
<s> the door was locked </s>
<s> a single kick made it spring open shuddering </s>
<s> pat saw gyp carmer staggering forward a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike </s>
<s> russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside </s>
<s> with a bellow carmer lunged at him </s>
<s> but he was more than half-drunk and his faculties were dulled </s>
<s> cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan </s>
<s> he started to struggle up heaving desperately </s>
<s> russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach </s>
<s> kneeling cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back holding him pinned </s>
<s> complying methodically pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing </s>
<s> cobb watched this with hunted eyes his desperate hope waning by the moment </s>
<s> cobb got it </s>
<s> straightening up his eyes ablaze he held out the battered stetson </s>
<s> inside the crown stuffed behind the stained sweatband could be seen thin crumpled wads of currency </s>
<s> pat grunted </s>
<s> russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly </s>
<s> pat nodded </s>
<s> handing the money over russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean </s>
<s> his glance at gyp carmer was disdainful </s>
<s> leaving the card room they moved back through the palace the way they had come </s>
<s> glowering looks met them in the bar but there was no attempt to halt them </s>
<s> pausing in the outside door to glance behind him pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out </s>
<s> he and cobb clattered down the high steps to the street </s>
<s> neither spoke till they reached their horses </s>
<s> pat paused there looking across at the young fellow </s>
<s> he started to return it </s>
<s> to his faint surprise russ held up his hand </s>
<s> pat swung into the saddle yet still he delayed his brows puckered </s>
<s> but i want this to sink in awhile </s>
<s> giving the other a dark look he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street </s>
<s> pat let him go following more leisurely </s>
<s> at the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner and as a consequence did not see cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for antler </s>
<s> the truth was the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck </s>
<s> yet had he not visited the girl at saw buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle </s>
<s> he asked himself </s>
<s> nearing home he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun </s>
<s> in town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot </s>
<s> but on the range gunfire had a meaning </s>
<s> hauling up russ listened carefully </s>
<s> as near as cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the antler ranch house </s>
<s> he tightened up in a twinkling </s>
<s> so far as he knew only his father could be there </s>
<s> clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter with growing alarm </s>
<s> his first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing </s>
<s> still a quarter-mile away the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed </s>
<s> setting a course straight for the house he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face </s>
<s> when it was followed by a second whining even closer cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression </s>
<s> he knew now what he was up against </s>
<s> whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the antler house and having spotted his approach was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight </s>
<s> cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot russ drew his colt and examined it briefly </s>
<s> if he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested he had his answer a moment later </s>
<s> a harsh cry floated to him across the brush </s>
<s> a carbine cracked more loudly and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side </s>
<s> the would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close </s>
<s> dismounting russ looked about hastily </s>
<s> toward the west this depression led toward a draw </s>
<s> leading his pony he hurried that way not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range </s>
<s> swinging up then and bending forward over the horn he urged his mount down the meandering draw </s>
<s> he had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind </s>
<s> he had been sighted and his attacker pumping shot after shot </s>
<s> a shot or two went wild before cobb felt something tug at his foot </s>
<s> a slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away </s>
<s> a second twitched his shirtsleeve and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm </s>
<s> another snarled close overhead </s>
<s> at the first shot russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw </s>
<s> the long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless </s>
<s> sweeping a look around he saw that he was safe for the moment </s>
<s> he heard cries from behind him but he could make out no words </s>
<s> he dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw and made it </s>
<s> recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw he plunged forward with undiminished speed </s>
<s> gradually the wash climbed upward forcing him toward open range </s>
<s> yet he must chance it </s>
<s> he clambered out of the dwindling wash the loose dirt flying behind him and flashed a look about </s>
<s> early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions </s>
<s> and sweeney squadron put its first marks on the combat record </s>
<s> every plane that could fly was sent into the air </s>
<s> cricket took eight ships and went south across the straits and along the north coast of mindanao to cagayan </s>
<s> anything the enemy flew or floated was his target </s>
<s> fleischman with eight was to patrol the leyte gulf area with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships </s>
<s> greg himself took two flights with todman leading the second to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around ormoc on the east coast of leyte </s>
<s> each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs </s>
<s> a weapons carrier took greg todman belton banjo ferguson and walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip </s>
<s> it was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes </s>
<s> no one had much to say </s>
<s> the sky glowered down at them </s>
<s> there was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever </s>
<s> the truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle </s>
<s> his face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot </s>
<s> greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before </s>
<s> but his hands and those of donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure </s>
<s> the expression was his trade-mark his open sesame to good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return </s>
<s> at the prearranged time greg started the engine and taxied out </s>
<s> from the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight he knew donovan would keep his back to the strip </s>
<s> he wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission </s>
<s> yet long before the scheduled time for return donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky </s>
<s> greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him </s>
<s> the dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful </s>
<s> the pilots heads looked ridiculously small </s>
<s> the control tower gave him immediate take-off permission and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan </s>
<s> to the west the dark green hills of leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes </s>
<s> underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray </s>
<s> water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers </s>
<s> the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it </s>
<s> he shivered in the warm cockpit </s>
<s> the overcast was solid above him </s>
<s> as far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it </s>
<s> greg pushed the radio button on his throttle </s>
<s> he dropped down to five hundred feet swinging a little north of the city of tacloban and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain </s>
<s> the valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn </s>
<s> it was only a fifteen-minute flight but before it was through greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia </s>
<s> the ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in </s>
<s> if the other pilots were worried they did not show it </s>
<s> the formation remained perfect </s>
<s> when the sea was visible ahead of them the relief was as great as if the sun had come out </s>
<s> he spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast </s>
<s> although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity </s>
<s> once todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while greg covered him </s>
<s> todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation </s>
<s> visibility continued to be limited and greg was never able to get above a thousand feet </s>
<s> it was frustrating </s>
<s> his earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights </s>
<s> he thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of fleischman claiming a kill </s>
<s> finally as time began to run out he headed into ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies </s>
<s> the low clouds made bombing difficult </s>
<s> there was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run </s>
<s> the accuracy was deplorable </s>
<s> only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle </s>
<s> with their load of bombs gone the planes moved swiftly and easily </s>
<s> greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home </s>
<s> mercifully it was still open </s>
<s> like a man making a deep dive greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley </s>
<s> three bogies </s>
<s> he saw them specks against the gray but closing fast </s>
<s> they were headed straight for each other on a collision course </s>
<s> the same old question </s>
<s> and only a few seconds to answer it </s>
<s> todman said excitedly and hopefully </s>
<s> and then he thought todman might be right </s>
<s> his mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification </s>
<s> he narrowed the shape down to two either a zero or a u s navy type aircraft </s>
<s> if it were the enemy tactically his position was correct </s>
<s> japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability american on speed and firepower </s>
<s> his present maximum altitude up against the overcast gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages </s>
<s> but the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course </s>
<s> in seconds greg made his decision </s>
<s> he pushed the radio button </s>
<s> lots of throttle </s>

<s> the planes light with most of the gas burned out responded beautifully </s>

<s> greg wished the air corps had continued to camouflage planes </s>
<s> there was of course no way for the other planes to get by them </s>
<s> it was a box </s>
<s> but they could turn and escape to the east </s>
<s> greg pushed the radio button again </s>
<s> if any of us miss they can pick up the pieces </s>
<s> even as he said it greg knew they had found the enemy </s>
<s> the shapes were unmistakable and the rising suns were showing up slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom </s>
<s> greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight </s>
<s> the circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him </s>
<s> his hands shook </s>
<s> one pass only </s>
<s> no turns </s>
<s> he moved the flights over against one wall </s>

<s> if the turn was too tight a barrel roll would bring them out </s>
<s> a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be done </s>
<s> greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the rpm and the engine responded as if it had been waiting </s>
<s> the clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around </s>
<s> he hit the radio button </s>
<s> he hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag </s>
<s> out of the corner of his eye he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him </s>
<s> perfect he thought </s>
<s> with the rapid rate of closure the approach from below the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could be done </s>
<s> just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board </s>
<s> he tightened his turn </s>

<s> eight aircraft in this small box </s>
<s> please dear god make my pilots good he prayed </s>

<s> the plane rumbled and slowed </s>

<s> luck was with him </s>

<s> a large piece of engine cowling vanished </s>
<s> it was all greg had time to see </s>

<s> wingman stay clear he prayed </s>
<s> he pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back </s>
<s> he fought the panic of vertigo </s>

<s> sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip </s>
<s> his air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out </s>
<s> over the rattling of fenders humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles </s>

<s> forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line i scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old mexican moriarty new mexico </s>

<s> gauche rainbow shapes replaced the poignant ovals of gold </s>
<s> autos whizzed past </s>
<s> white-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze </s>
<s> damn his luck </s>
<s> still nursing anger i listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me </s>
<s> it was stopping </s>
<s> the voice was that of johnson tail gunner off another crew </s>
<s> i nodded </s>

<s> johnson never would have believed she had a son that age </s>
<s> and re-echo </s>
<s> the straight black hair flopped in a vigorous nod the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back </s>
<s> johnson unwired the right hand door whose window was like the left one merely loosely-taped fragments of glass and johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer </s>
<s> quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack i stepped on the running board </s>

<s> the truck was hurtling forward </s>
<s> maybe i would beat old herry to siberia after all </s>
<s> whatever satisfaction that might offer </s>
<s> something pulled my leg </s>
<s> i drew back drawing back my foot for a kick </s>

<s> johnson was trying to grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it </s>
<s> we were off the road gleaming barbed wire pulling taut </s>
<s> i ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards </s>
<s> we were in a field in a tight screeching turn </s>
<s> prairie dogs were popping up and popping down </s>
<s> when i fell on my back i saw a vulture hovering </s>
<s> just as i got to my knees there was again the sound of the fence stretching and i had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously </s>
<s> this time no wire came whipping into the truck </s>
<s> we were back on the road </s>
<s> i nodded </s>
<s> no sooner had i started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck </s>
<s> the beer foamed furiously </s>
<s> i drank furiously </s>
<s> a long time </s>
<s> emptied the bottle </s>
<s> i bobbed my head each time it appeared </s>
<s> a big car was approaching its chrome teeth grinning </s>
<s> beyond it the gray road stretched a long long way </s>
<s> i tossed the bottle </s>
<s> too high </s>
<s> on unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash </s>
<s> another car was coming a tiny dark shape on a far hill </s>
<s> we were slowing </s>
<s> in the ditch sand was white and soft-looking only an occasional pebble discernible faintly gleaming </s>
<s> the car was approaching fast </s>
<s> on the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery </s>
<s> suddenly and not a second too soon i thought of the coins in my pocket </s>
<s> there was no time to pick out a penny </s>
<s> i got a coin between my thumb and forefinger leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile </s>
<s> there was a blur just under my focus of vision a crash </s>
<s> i heard the screech of brakes behind me an insane burst of laughter beneath me </s>
<s> looking back i saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number </s>
<s> two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing </s>
<s> brakes shrieked behind us </s>
<s> this time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women </s>
<s> i quickly turned around and began to drink </s>
<s> but the indian was jabbing another bottle toward johnson </s>
<s> i guided her to the divan turned off the tv faced her </s>
<s> she sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes </s>
<s> and what eyes they were </s>
<s> big and dark a melting golden brown </s>
<s> eyes like hot honey eyes that sizzled </s>
<s> plus flawless skin smooth brow and cheeks lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them </s>
<s> she smiled </s>
<s> it was her first smile </s>
<s> but worth waiting for </s>
<s> i said </s>
<s> she stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off then let out a high-pitched scream and i let out a low-pitched wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out </s>
<s> she was wearing nothing beneath the coat </s>
<s> she jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again but not soon enough </s>
<s> she yelped </s>
<s> then it hit me </s>
<s> i cried </s>
<s> in fact i was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell </s>
<s> i sat by her on the divan </s>
<s> it was fun for me all right </s>
<s> i never wear anything at all </s>
<s> she told me </s>
<s> zing was the creation of two men louis thor and bill blake partners in zing </s>
<s> inc </s>
<s> even to clean men and boys </s>
<s> he wanted a few stills for magazine ads he said </s>
<s> everybody left and i stayed in the pool then lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too </s>
<s> she paused </s>
<s> i swam like mad got out of the pool grabbed my robe and ran to the car </s>
<s> she went on </s>
<s> maybe lou was only unconscious but right then i thought he must be dead </s>
<s> the man shoved him into the water then ran past the cabana </s>
<s> her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming tv series underwater western eye a documentary-type show to be sponsored by oatnut grits </s>
<s> or at least not to joyce </s>
<s> as far as i was concerned she had already and had dandily shown what she could do </s>
<s> but i promised joyce i would mention her name if at all only as a last resort </s>
<s> seeming much relieved she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles and i smiled all the way into the bedroom </s>
<s> there i got my colt special and shoulder harness slipped my coat on and went back into the front room </s>
<s> joyce squirmed a little on the divan </s>
<s> that always relaxes me </s>
<s> i shook my head </s>
<s> one of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color </s>
<s> i looked at my watch </s>
<s> ten after nine </s>
<s> time to go i supposed </s>
<s> she smiled slightly </s>
<s> softly </s>
<s> warmly </s>
<s> that was all she said </s>
<s> but suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them </s>
<s> i spun about and clattered through the front room to the door </s>
<s> as i went out i could hear water pouring in the shower </s>
<s> hot water </s>
<s> bryn mawr drive is only two or three miles from the spartan and it took me less than five minutes to get there </s>
<s> four cars were parked at the curb and two of them were police radio cars </s>
<s> lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds </s>
<s> i followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool </s>
<s> two uniformed officers a couple of plain-clothesmen i knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left </s>
<s> i grinned but ignored the question </s>
<s> he filled me in </s>
<s> neither of them i understood had been present at the filming session earlier </s>
<s> i asked rawlins </s>
<s> too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living </s>
<s> if it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics i would have been stymied on what to do and now i understand why they are classics </s>
<s> those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick </s>
<s> the arrangement i had with him was to work four hours a day </s>
<s> the rest of the time i devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting </s>
<s> i had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants blooming everlastingly in the southern sun </s>
<s> i had come to new orleans two years earlier after graduating college partly because i loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there </s>
<s> when my uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint i accepted </s>
<s> the arrangement turned out to be excellent </s>
<s> i loved the city and i particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of mardi gras </s>
<s> i had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide joyous celebration with romance in the air </s>
<s> and when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner </s>
<s> the very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure </s>
<s> it was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes cover their faces with masks and go adventuring </s>
<s> my uncle and i were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages </s>
<s> sometimes i wondered vaguely what he did about women for my aunt by blood had died some years ago but neither of us said anything </s>
<s> one monday morning i saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new aunt </s>
<s> they were married over the week-end though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty </s>
<s> she looked more like twenty-five or six </s>
<s> it was really a may and december combination </s>
<s> my new aunt was perhaps three or four years older than i and it had been a long time since i had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex </s>
<s> her legs were the full sexy kind full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite </s>
<s> the calf was magnificent the ankle perfect </s>
<s> you must forgive me if i seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but i am an artist accustomed to studying the physical body </s>
<s> and that is the way i first saw her when my uncle brought her into his antique store </s>
<s> that she impressed me instantly was obvious </s>
<s> i was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them </s>
<s> i thought i saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks </s>
<s> true she was my aunt married to an uncle related to me only by marriage but why she had married a man twice her age and more perhaps i did not know or much care </s>
<s> she was standing with her back to the glass door </s>
<s> her form was silhouetted and with the strong light i could see the outlines of her body a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired </s>
<s> as it is in so many affairs of the heart a man and a woman meet and something clicks </s>
<s> something clicked in this instance but i treated her circumspectly and i felt that she knew it for we both kept our distance </s>
<s> when she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my uncle notice it </s>
<s> and then i became aware that she too glanced at me surreptitiously </s>
<s> i felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and i a nude model </s>
<s> i dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but i could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship </s>
<s> you have probably experienced this </s>
<s> it is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity </s>
<s> why she married him i do not know </s>
<s> i myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me </s>
<s> he already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living </s>
<s> perhaps with my uncle she found a measure of economic security that she needed </s>
<s> or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father </s>
<s> some women with father fixations do </s>
<s> for several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners and then one day uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home </s>
<s> his bride opened the store </s>
<s> even as she was telling me about it i became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks and subconsciously i realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights </s>
<s> the cavernous depth cluttered with antiques echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk </s>
<s> i was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune </s>
<s> there was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour </s>
<s> i was standing beside her watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped </s>
<s> i bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush </s>
<s> her mouth which had been so much in my thoughts was warm and moist and tender </s>
<s> it did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch </s>
<s> when we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said </s>
<s> i was thinking about that </s>
<s> you figure it out </s>
<s> i said </s>
<s> even as i said it i realized that an education can be invaluable </s>
<s> she raised a protesting hand with a startled air </s>
<s> she said incredulously </s>
<s> in those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell </s>
<s> and now i think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us </s>
<s> tomorrow mardi gras opens officially </s>
<s> a lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having a ball </s>
<s> there will be romance and flirtation </s>
<s> if you tell him i made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something i said or did so instead of just telling him i made a pass say i tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse i really am </s>
<s> we made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near lake ponchartrain </s>
<s> and to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead </s>
<s> you are both the same size </s>
<s> he could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask </s>
<s> i felt that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife </s>
<s> i quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days </s>
<s> i heard subsequently that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the french quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date </s>
<s> shortly before nine i drove my jalopy to the street facing the lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view </s>
<s> i must say the figure was well made up </s>
<s> if it were not that i knew who it was i could have mistaken it for my aunt so well did her clothes fit him </s>
<s> in one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain </s>
<s> i suspected why he brought it along </s>
<s> in the half darkness i approached cautiously making sure he did not see me </s>
<s> he was looking out on the dark waters of the lake when i came upon him and without wasting words i smacked him hard across the face </s>
<s> i exclaimed </s>
<s> he had better write a postcard to walter </s>
<s> the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer </s>
<s> the code which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest nicolas was determined to find out and put to use </s>
<s> a card to walter would get him an introduction to this meredith and that might be good for something </s>
<s> nicolas called on his muse a line came back </s>
<s> that ought to draw a laugh nicolas reasoned as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind </s>
<s> and indeed his postcard did draw from walter a letter recommending his friend the poet nicolas manas to his friend meredith wilder </s>
<s> five days later on receiving it meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table </s>
<s> dammit </s>
<s> he inwardly cried </s>
<s> his hand was large and square and heavily tanned </s>
<s> the voice crying in him was the voice of guilt </s>
<s> his four weeks in italy had turned into nearer three months </s>
<s> he had returned to the pension a week ago </s>
<s> he was determined to spend an industrious summer </s>
<s> and he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape nicolas manas </s>
<s> but nicolas too was being interrupted that morning </s>
<s> but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him </s>
<s> her heart her maternal feeling in fact her being was too busy expressing itself as quietly thrilled by this sight of her nicolas curled asleep under a blanket in a park like a scene from poussin </s>
<s> she was just not able to break the spell </s>
<s> he had always known how to find a bed and on his own terms </s>
<s> he used the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions </s>
<s> mary jane lerner knew none of this </s>
<s> she was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth </s>
<s> this was surely a reunion in art it was all that poetry promised </s>
<s> that long night with nicolas and marijuana in venice had opened her eyes </s>
<s> her eyes had opened she had caught a glimpse of a new faith </s>
<s> the next day he was gone </s>
<s> mary jane might not be the most intelligent woman but she was one of the most determined </s>
<s> she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens </s>
<s> mary jane had smilingly said </s>
<s> and i will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband </s>
<s> his presence there asleep in the grass confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power to teach her freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning of nature how to live simply with the angels </s>
<s> she set down her suitcase </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> smiling she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched </s>
<s> the sun grew hotter as it approached the midday </s>
<s> nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car </s>
<s> he began sweating </s>
<s> he half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass </s>
<s> his nose was tickled </s>
<s> he sneezed </s>
<s> he blew his nose expertly between his fingers </s>
<s> he spit </s>
<s> he half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then more vigorously between his legs </s>
<s> he belched he stretched </s>
<s> mary jane got up quietly and walked away </s>
<s> mary jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities </s>
<s> she had retreated to this world </s>
<s> families are very interesting </s>
<s> nevertheless there is no bath </s>
<s> but a young american has a bath next to his room and i shall ask him if you might use it this once </s>
<s> and then we shall see </s>
<s> actually she is a sad beauty i believe </s>
<s> rather erotically he listened to the bath water running </s>
<s> when it stopped he began busily typing sitting up in a virtuous way </s>
<s> before dinner he shaved for the second time that day </s>
<s> a thing he did not like doing generally </s>
<s> singing into the mirror and his interested eyes he was pleased to note when he stripped for his own bath that he still had the best part of his italian sun tan </s>
<s> he flexed his muscles for several minutes got into the tub and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed </s>
<s> in the small gallery used as the guests dining room meredith sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young waitress </s>
<s> yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the grafin as acknowledgement that here indeed was something special </s>
<s> mary jane had made very little effort </s>
<s> above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with as he soon perceived no brassiere beneath </s>
<s> her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders </s>
<s> perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day </s>
<s> she had touched her face truly a noble and pure face only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual </s>
<s> the result was grace and modesty </s>
<s> meredith began falling in love </s>
<s> </s>
<s> </s>
<s> a smile </s>
<s> having opened the windows onto the terrace lit the fire translated the motto meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin </s>
<s> opening these he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden inside it </s>
<s> it tastes a little like poppyseed </s>
<s> in reading on platforms even in the large auditorium of the ymha poetry center nights his voice was intimate thoughtful and a trifle shy </s>
<s> his new poem a love poem told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed </s>
<s> mary jane took the page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words </s>
<s> the third time rather urgently </s>
<s> but with her hand poem again </s>
<s> they discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds </s>
<s> they finished the small bottle of steinhager </s>
<s> they smiled </s>
<s> the third time rather urgently </s>
<s> but with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited expectant and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth </s>
<s> they were west of the sabine but only god knew where </s>
<s> for three days their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea </s>
<s> molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson </s>
<s> suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping </s>
<s> dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs </s>
<s> and the valley stretched endlessly out ahead scorched and baked and writhing in its heat until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze </s>
<s> ben prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen </s>
<s> he commanded from his raw throat and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips </s>
<s> he removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face </s>
<s> he spat </s>
<s> the dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton </s>
<s> he moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs </s>
<s> the burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches </s>
<s> he cleared his throat and wet his lips </s>
<s> he unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel </s>
<s> they could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation </s>
<s> the water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste </s>
<s> but it was water </s>
<s> thank the lord they still had water </s>
<s> he cleansed his mouth with a small quantity </s>
<s> he took a long but carefully controlled draught </s>
<s> he replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck </s>
<s> she took it grudgingly her dark eyes baleful as they met his </s>
<s> she drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face </s>
<s> she set the dipper on the edge of the deck leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully </s>
<s> she asked smolderingly </s>
<s> her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal </s>
<s> her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up </s>
<s> and all the time she had the heat of hatred in her like charcoal that is burning on its under side but not visibly </s>
<s> a ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws but he kept control upon his voice </s>
<s> he tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river </s>
<s> she scoffed </s>
<s> her chin sharpened </s>
<s> there was no valley like this on your map </s>
<s> his wide mouth compressed </s>
<s> he had picked out this pathless trail instead of the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give them privacy on their honeymoon </s>
<s> it had been a mistake but anything would have been a mistake as it turned out </s>
<s> she had hated the whole idea before they started </s>
<s> actually she had hated him before she ever saw him </s>
<s> the bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound </s>
<s> she had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder </s>
<s> he had left her inviolate thinking familiarity would gentle her in time </s>
<s> but each mile westward she had hated him the deeper </s>
<s> he stared at the dipper turning it over and over in his wide calloused hands </s>
<s> her laugh was hard </s>
<s> he winced </s>
<s> he darkened under his heavy burn </s>
<s> his blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead </s>
<s> to his puzzlement there suddenly was no haze </s>
<s> the valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead </s>
<s> he had never seen clouds like them before but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in carolina </s>
<s> and goaded the oxen as he yelled </s>
<s> he wanted to turn them putting the wagon against the storm </s>
<s> too late he realized that in turning he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground instead of atop a grade or ridge </s>
<s> he swung up over the wheel </s>
<s> but she sat on in stubborn silence </s>
<s> the clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel </s>
<s> frozen they stared at it whirling down the valley gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones </s>
<s> the six-ton conestoga began to whip and shake </s>
<s> their world turned black </s>
<s> it was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence </s>
<s> the heavens opened pelting them with hail the size of walnuts </s>
<s> walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods </s>
<s> through the splash of the rising waters they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon gnashing big chunks out of the banks </s>
<s> the jetting frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff </s>
<s> the dangerous current upon the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising </s>
<s> they cringed under sodden covers listening to the waves slop against the bottom </s>
<s> the cloudburst cut off abruptly </s>
<s> they were engulfed by the weird silence broken only by the low angry murmur of the river </s>
<s> then the darkness thinned and there was light again and then bright sunlight </s>
<s> beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills </s>
<s> the water level was higher than their hubs </s>
<s> only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored </s>
<s> there was no real sign of the river now just a roiling oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere </s>
<s> clumps of brush rode down the ribbon </s>
<s> now and then the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past </s>
<s> the girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine hugging her shoulders and still trembling </s>
<s> her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for ben </s>
<s> at least the wheels dug in </s>
<s> she was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current </s>
<s> somebody was riding the tree </s>
<s> it raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair sitting astride an upright branch </s>
<s> she did not call out </s>
<s> but as the tree passed she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell </s>
<s> they watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend </s>
<s> it speared up into the air then sinking back the up-jutting branch turned slowly </s>
<s> the pale blob of the woman disappeared </s>
<s> the girl murmured harshly </s>
<s> then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts needing their comfort more than they needed his </s>
<s> it was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon half-swimming his way for he was not a tall man </s>
<s> he let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water </s>
<s> he sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward </s>
<s> they were already swollen to bursting </s>
<s> of all their worldly belongings next to the oxen and his gun the seed grain had been the most treasured </s>
<s> it was spoiled now for seed and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it </s>
<s> the oxen might as well enjoy it </s>
<s> he examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished </s>
<s> the waters lay muddy but placid without a ripple of movement against the wheels </s>
<s> there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding </s>
<s> he doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate dry hills that rimmed the valley </s>
<s> a terrible numbing sense of futility swept over him </s>
<s> he gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat </s>
<s> then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen </s>
<s> the spokes were tight again the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece </s>
<s> hope surged within him </s>
<s> he swung toward the front to give the news to hettie then stopped barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate </s>
<s> still he felt better </s>
<s> a tight wagon meant so much </s>
<s> he got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee </s>
<s> he poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour salvaging the chunky watery messes for biscuits of a sort </s>
<s> their jams and jellies had not suffered </s>
<s> he found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save </s>
<s> now he broke them open hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing hettie </s>
<s> his long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java but the fire was low and he wanted to waste no time </s>
<s> he furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins leaving the ribs and wagon open </s>
<s> he drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs </s>
<s> sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of </s>
<s> i suppose a lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze </s>
<s> now roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep not knowing what to do </s>
<s> the lifeboats were stuck fast </s>
<s> he sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters </s>
<s> heave on those ropes </s>
<s> we pulled and swore and yanked and wept scraping our hands until they bled profusely </s>
<s> the bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare </s>
<s> her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water </s>
<s> brassnose max and i leaped into the sea and swam to the boat </s>
<s> then the bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam geysers of sparks and flames and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke </s>
<s> already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water </s>
<s> three days previously we had steamed past barren rennell island in the distance </s>
<s> now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the pacific for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon </s>
<s> there were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands </s>
<s> our muscles were hot wires of pain </s>
<s> brassnose was strangely silent </s>
<s> he then said something which struck a chord in my memory </s>
<s> i was puzzled by the remark then i recalled the voice of mild professor howard griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies </s>
<s> he had been speaking of this archipelago </s>
<s> three hours later while we were bailing desperately a dot of land came into view </s>
<s> foster lukuklu frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs i recognized it as an ancient manu gesture intended to propitiate the devil </s>
<s> a half-hour passed </s>
<s> we had drifted closer </s>
<s> i squinted at the looming shoreline </s>
<s> there was a wooden tower or derrick there something like a ski jump </s>
<s> a fine example of engineering in a primitive society </s>
<s> he made a sound of despair deep in his throat </s>
<s> it was embarrassing to see strapping blonde brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen </s>
<s> it is their tultul the jumping platform of death </s>
<s> it is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose to discover if a male is worthy of survival there </s>
<s> often i heard my uncles and cousins speak of it when i was a small boy growing up in rabaul </s>
<s> our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what i had heard of the inhabitants of eromonga i was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft </s>
<s> but he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked </s>
<s> in ngandlu </s>
<s> my friends and i come from a ship which was destroyed by fire </s>
<s> we are thirsty and hungry </s>
<s> the girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me </s>
<s> i noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair </s>
<s> you are welcome to eromonga </s>
<s> my people await you on the shore </s>
<s> thirty minutes later the outrigger grated on sand and other girls waiting on shore rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder </s>
<s> i saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there </s>
<s> i looked </s>
<s> all my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight </s>
<s> there was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick </s>
<s> some had been there for years </s>
<s> others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them </s>
<s> there was one object which sickened yet fascinated me </s>
<s> the body may have been two or three weeks dead </s>
<s> i looked with revulsion at the legs </s>
<s> they were shattered </s>
<s> many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh </s>
<s> the man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul </s>
<s> as if divining my thoughts the girl songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an american woman might use in describing her rose garden </s>
<s> later you shall know it better </s>
<s> our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago </s>
<s> it took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one which is higher and stronger than the old one </s>
<s> he looked as if he was going to keel over </s>
<s> not so soon anyway </s>
<s> he speaks your language too for he is the grandson of a chieftain on taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning </s>
<s> this was the worst thing i could have said </s>
<s> they despise males who brag of their strength </s>
<s> they destroy such men with their damned tests </s>
<s> at first i thought he was out of his head talking wildly like this </s>
<s> but a glance at songau and the other women confirmed what brassnose had blurted out </s>
<s> the man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle </s>
<s> but four eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived </s>
<s> my last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face </s>
<s> though i had a great dread of the island and felt i would never leave it alive i eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women </s>
<s> miraculously karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of pamasu back to their war canoes after considerable loss of life on both sides </s>
<s> karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist </s>
<s> she quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death </s>
<s> within a decade or less few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up </s>
<s> those who stayed had to pass tests </s>
<s> she cackled with mirth showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth </s>
<s> the old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood </s>
<s> in the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling i saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground </s>
<s> ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack </s>
<s> somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver </s>
<s> for a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened </s>
<s> maybe he was only doing the best he knew how like any of us </s>
<s> he said to his partner </s>
<s> benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble </s>
<s> ramey smiled but he thought to himself i always see me too </s>
<s> never benny </s>
<s> whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind </s>
<s> then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think </s>
<s> with this realization sometimes he saw himself as he looked down </s>
<s> benson said referring to the indian </s>
<s> a few minutes later the insurance man a road checker drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state </s>
<s> it was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed </s>
<s> sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed </s>
<s> all the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane </s>
<s> horsely an agent on the east end wore the hat trying to look like a tourist </s>
<s> it had always seemed strange to ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist an ex-truck driver like horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head </s>
<s> he chatted with ramey and benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer </s>
<s> every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear </s>
<s> when they were ready to leave benson and ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer </s>
<s> she had driven up with her husband in a convertible with eastern license plates although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that </s>
<s> she wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt </s>
<s> slender and tanned her dark brown hair was drawn straight back simply </s>
<s> benson said </s>
<s> seeing her caused a lurch in ramey a recognition </s>
<s> she might have been someone he had once loved </s>
<s> he had never seen her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson went in and out of the cities at each end of their run </s>
<s> the feeling subsided it was only a small yearning </s>
<s> their work was lonely </s>
<s> benson said and ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been </s>
<s> the girl looked around at the countryside </s>
<s> her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing </s>
<s> it made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on </s>
<s> she began to watch a blonde-haired man also in shorts standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly </s>
<s> what had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see but benson knew what it was </s>
<s> the girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her </s>
<s> the man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the indian who lay face down almost under the car </s>
<s> the two drivers moved closer </s>
<s> benson said to ramey </s>
<s> one tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain </s>
<s> the laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top </s>
<s> the slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toes were still inside </s>
<s> the two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man </s>
<s> he wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v at the neck the sleeves pushed above the elbows </s>
<s> he turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes immaculate eyes </s>
<s> the man said </s>
<s> he turned and bent over the body of the indian </s>
<s> it was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine </s>
<s> the man said backing up a step still looking down </s>
<s> his words were mostly to himself </s>
<s> the man said with a tone of impatience </s>
<s> the man had spoken only once </s>
<s> ramey heard the words again inside weakened the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears </s>
<s> ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin </s>
<s> the man seemed to sink a little as ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again with his fist </s>
<s> ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth </s>
<s> it was a straight solid once-in-a-lifetime shot </s>
<s> the man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement </s>
<s> ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand </s>
<s> as he watched the man sit suddenly a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was really to knock a man off his feet </s>
<s> with a thoughtful look the man sat on the pavement legs straight out in front of him </s>
<s> his arms hung like empty shirt sleeves and his mouth was slightly open </s>
<s> after what seemed several seconds the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it </s>
<s> the man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth </s>
<s> he moaned and pulled the hand away </s>
<s> even yet there was no realization in his eyes </s>
<s> ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him </s>
<s> he did not look around </s>
<s> someone said </s>
<s> the man on the ground began to move </s>
<s> one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him </s>
<s> blood dripped down the front of his sweater soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder as though the bright v woven into the neckline had melted running a darker color </s>
<s> the girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back </s>
<s> she begged </s>
<s> an incoherent puzzled sound came from the red mouth </s>
<s> the girl looked around quickly at several of the people </s>
<s> none of the crowd had stepped forward to help </s>
<s> then she saw ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment </s>
<s> she said her voice rising </s>
<s> ramey said nothing </s>
<s> a shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again </s>
<s> behind ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers </s>
<s> no one seemed to know for sure what had happened nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver beyond finding out </s>
<s> ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman </s>
<s> benson moved his arms gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly </s>
<s> ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man </s>
<s> some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at ramey </s>
<s> ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer </s>
<s> the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis </s>
<s> he walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him </s>
<s> his brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it </s>
<s> the body continued to lash but now keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome bloody mass out of the bungalow </s>
<s> he slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up alarmed at the sound of the shots </s>
<s> he heard their chattering and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes </s>
<s> it was only then that he turned to look at penny </s>
<s> she was sitting on the edge of the bed again back in the same position where the snake had found her </s>
<s> the fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some other emotions now crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth </s>
<s> but her hands were calm now </s>
<s> he smiled at her sincerity </s>
<s> and for the hundredth time that week he was startled at her beauty </s>
<s> strange </s>
<s> he knew her mind pretty well by now its quick perceptions and sympathies its painful insistence on truth and directness its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate even in part </s>
<s> but her beauty always surprised him anew </s>
<s> penny lowered her eyes </s>
<s> asked keith his voice getting harsher in spite of himself as he struggled to control his growing anger </s>
<s> penny did not answer </s>
<s> now she just sat there looking at him without an expression except concern for him </s>
<s> keith was snarling now </s>
<s> all of us that is except me </s>
<s> you hate me you hate my guts because i like to hunt </s>
<s> penny would not rise to his mood </s>
<s> she softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side away from the door where she slept better because keith was between her and the invader </s>
<s> he knew she was not sulking not even angry at him </s>
<s> just as he knew that she had stopped loving him </s>
<s> the brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world the towering white headwalls of the himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet </s>
<s> keith sterling had looked down on the brahmaputra more times than he could remember during the war days when he flew over the hump of the world thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space </s>
<s> but keith looked down more than up </s>
<s> he thought of the jungles below him and of the wild strange untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted and animals the lords </s>
<s> at first it had been just a romantic dream of his the same as the idea of finishing oxford after the war </s>
<s> wing commanders in the raf do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves </s>
<s> he became a fighter pilot after the stint over the hump in the big crates </s>
<s> he knew how to shoot down nazis </s>
<s> that was true but only half the truth </s>
<s> he enjoyed the killing </s>
<s> not defending england or being an ace or fighting for humanity </s>
<s> he enjoyed killing </s>
<s> and he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a nazi </s>
<s> nowadays we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish </s>
<s> the nazis bombed britain so the raf retaliated and shot them all down </s>
<s> not quite </s>
<s> it was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the british on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the nazis who were better organized and technically superior </s>
<s> it took a long time before the british tipped the balance </s>
<s> keith learned too much about air combat and air killing to be risked </s>
<s> that was where he met penny </s>
<s> penny knew him better on her part </s>
<s> he had a war reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without medals </s>
<s> he had strength in his six-foot frame but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier </s>
<s> he was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep </s>
<s> his hair was black already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom the only one permitted to a man </s>
<s> keith was an eagle </s>
<s> penny and keith had no romance </s>
<s> no dates or hand-holding </s>
<s> but they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly </s>
<s> the command offices were in the border country up north where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy </s>
<s> the nazis knew this of course and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers they let a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit </s>
<s> this time they had been lucky </s>
<s> the command post was underground and well camouflaged </s>
<s> there was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer if as efficacious when a direct hit comes along </s>
<s> the bomb plunged into the ground near the post but not precisely into the command room itself </s>
<s> that is everyone but keith and penny </s>
<s> they stood there just the two of them in the rocking shattering blast </s>
<s> the bomb was a solitary one </s>
<s> the blast damaged but did not destroy the room </s>
<s> and as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across the debris to penny and took her hand in his </s>
<s> the chaplain married them on the next day </s>
<s> after the war penny had wanted keith at least to visit her home with her </s>
<s> keith told penny about his dream to return to india and burma </s>
<s> he stressed the wild beauty of the mountains and the jungles </s>
<s> that was his true love not penny </s>
<s> the terrible power of a gun the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body man or beast was one he never wanted to lose </s>
<s> and in the hunting land this hunger was considered to be a noble thing </s>
<s> when they got to shillong in assam he was happy </s>
<s> this is a paradise for hunters </s>
<s> this was the land of the sladang the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread </s>
<s> the great black leopards </s>
<s> the sambur buck the jungle stag that is even more noble than the scottish elk </s>
<s> he even hunted elephant although the asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his african cousin </s>
<s> but there are big rogues in both countries </s>
<s> he and penny would go out on tame elephants raised from babyhood in the keddah </s>
<s> and while he was ever alert for game and most particularly a tiger penny marvelled at the eden they were traversing </s>
<s> they came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools </s>
<s> peacocks strutted across their path preening </s>
<s> there were fantastic flowers without perfume and gaudy birds without song </s>
<s> mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close </s>
<s> and robinson roy who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive was already back on the surface </s>
<s> he and his safety man herr schaffner swam up to the boarding ladder together </s>
<s> the german courteously indicated that robinson should mount first </s>
<s> robinson clambered heavily into the boat sat down and stripped off his triple-tank assembly </s>
<s> he was frowning </s>
<s> he took his mask from his forehead and threw it unexpectedly across the deck </s>
<s> a phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty but irreparably stringy in the neck she was already working on her second gin and tonic though it was not yet ten am </s>
<s> the german asked </s>
<s> he was a huge young man of twenty-four clothed in muscle immensely strong with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation </s>
<s> he stared stonily at the floor </s>
<s> and you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself </s>
<s> a note of awe came into his voice </s>
<s> not me anyway </s>
<s> he had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him </s>
<s> waddell the newspaperman was a fellow in his middle forties with a graying crewcut heavy-framed glasses and a large jaw padded with fat </s>
<s> now he was going to show how much he knew </s>
<s> he ran into the rapture of the depths </s>
<s> nitrogen narcosis </s>
<s> it can kill you </s>
<s> he stood there towering over them all gentle mighty determined the moving force in the group </s>
<s> and yet like a child among adults </s>
<s> mr forsythe exclaimed </s>
<s> he was a florid puffy man in his early sixties very natty in his yachting cap striped jacket and white flannels </s>
<s> old commodore forsythe who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first </s>
<s> now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object of his pride </s>
<s> he was thinking big deal skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when i started </s>
<s> he went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters </s>
<s> went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him </s>
<s> waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge </s>
<s> he was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the german who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley </s>
<s> waddell had looked the man over trying to size him up </s>
<s> he was in his early forties rather short and very compactly built and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to american ways </s>
<s> his open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence until one looked into his eyes which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence </s>
<s> aloud he had said making conversation </s>
<s> waddell turned to face him </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> shaffner looked at him altogether without guile and shrugged his shoulders making a little spreading gesture with his two hands </s>
<s> waddell asked frowning </s>
<s> now i wish to enter the american market where the competition is very strong </s>
<s> i must have a powerful representative here a firm with a national distribution and ten twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products </s>
<s> waddell was not an eminently moral person but he did not like what he had just heard </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> never never did i offer him the exclusive rights </s>
<s> we spoke of the need for advertising and i agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity </s>
<s> he was most eager to make the dive </s>
<s> of course i was willing </s>
<s> there was the end of his front-page feature story with byline </s>
<s> he started out the door </s>
<s> herr schaffner said </s>
<s> waddell asked </s>
<s> mr roy is determined to make this dive </s>
<s> whatever you tell him he will dive </s>
<s> waddell said </s>
<s> there was no doubt that herr schaffner meant every word of what he said </s>
<s> waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk </s>
<s> all tourists come to florida </s>
<s> this will help him to get out of his little tackle shop </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> he took a big swig of his drink </s>
<s> it would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this </s>
<s> he sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps </s>
<s> the story was shaping up nicely in his mind the young pioneer as of old altruistically braving the unknown </s>
<s> the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business america </s>
<s> he had asked </s>
<s> now in that same cabin robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk </s>
<s> fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions </s>
<s> he pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper </s>
<s> crossed himself </s>
<s> said a hail mary slowly and with understanding </s>
<s> folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck he took his appeal direct to headquarters </s>
<s> make it come off all right </s>
<s> let me set the record this time and let me get back ok so the german will give me the exclusive </s>
<s> and make my life different and better from this time on </s>
<s> he crossed himself again and rose </s>
<s> he felt a good deal less shaky </s>
<s> as he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found artie who came in and sat down on a bunk </s>
<s> artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger </s>
<s> early that day matsuo saw a marine </s>
<s> the enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and matsuo took a hasty shot then fled without knowing the result ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery </s>
<s> as his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand </s>
<s> he crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed </s>
<s> in the leafiest part of the tree straddling a broad horizontal limb he could see over the meadow </s>
<s> for a while he was content to let events develop in their good time </s>
<s> he had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column and while his shot had probably bred indecision they would soon come hunting </s>
<s> his superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure </s>
<s> yesterday </s>
<s> today </s>
<s> tomorrow no surrender </s>
<s> it was best to die fighting the marines </s>
<s> his superiors had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor </s>
<s> his comrades were all dead </s>
<s> he had no rice </s>
<s> then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide </s>
<s> whichever the way he would rot in this vast choking green his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes </s>
<s> he sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk </s>
<s> his fingers touched the bone handle of a knife </s>
<s> the knife an ammunition pouch and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt </s>
<s> besides the belt he wore a loin cloth </s>
<s> as he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing </s>
<s> gloom receded </s>
<s> the marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed as though debating whether to brave the sunlight </s>
<s> his fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist </s>
<s> the man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face </s>
<s> matsuo lifted his rifle easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness </s>
<s> fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills </s>
<s> they had fought from caves and the marines resorted to burning them out </s>
<s> even now like a ringing in his ears he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows </s>
<s> a wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached nagamo his friend and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet his uniform blazing </s>
<s> the marines let him advance </s>
<s> when he sank on his knees they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy </s>
<s> matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses both the burned and the unburned the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun </s>
<s> matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea </s>
<s> at nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle reeking of death </s>
<s> apprehensively he peered to the left to the right into the leafy vine-crisscrossed maze </s>
<s> he decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow with the one left to distract him </s>
<s> he strained his hearing </s>
<s> cautious feet stepping on leafmold </s>
<s> faint creaking of belts and slings </s>
<s> whispers he heard none of these </s>
<s> only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird </s>
<s> a spectacle occurred across the meadow the lone marine took a seat on the ground </s>
<s> leaning sidewise on a tree trunk he embraced it </s>
<s> humiliation made matsuo tremble </s>
<s> while his comrades cocked the trap that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver </s>
<s> he wanted the arrogant marine to know fear and so he aimed above the head </s>
<s> the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound </s>
<s> hush followed </s>
<s> like a mischievous boy expecting punishment matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle </s>
<s> how stupid to give his position away </s>
<s> the jungle did not retort </s>
<s> the sitter remained seated hugging the tree </s>
<s> before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy and insects hummed and birds occasionally called </s>
<s> matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke </s>
<s> five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight immediately throwing his hands over his eyes </s>
<s> he went into a whirling dance a sort of blind chasing of the tail </s>
<s> it ended when he tumbled </s>
<s> but jumping right up he staggered in no particular direction </s>
<s> he wore no head cover of any kind and more odd had no visible weapon </s>
<s> when he got closer to the tree matsuo noted the wild look on his face </s>
<s> the pockets of his jacket bulged </s>
<s> hand grenades </s>
<s> the bobbing head was a poor target so matsuo shot him in the upper trunk </s>
<s> the marine spun clapping a hand high on his chest and dived forward </s>
<s> in the hush that followed the echoes matsuo was tense </s>
<s> they could come on him now without difficulty </s>
<s> gradually he reached a conclusion </s>
<s> the marine was alone for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree </s>
<s> down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage </s>
<s> the marine was sprawled some thirty yards away one arm extended </s>
<s> matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out </s>
<s> rifle leveled on the man he made a rush </s>
<s> heat in the sunlight pressed in like an invisible crowd </s>
<s> he squatted by the head gently placing the rifle on the ground </s>
<s> with a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back </s>
<s> he was bearded </s>
<s> the bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone </s>
<s> around the hole blood glistened in a little patch </s>
<s> maintaining his clutch on the hair matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets </s>
<s> in the other a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief </s>
<s> one by one he tossed the objects aside </s>
<s> he had no use any longer for exact time even had the watch been running </s>
<s> then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief </s>
<s> too bad the marine had no water </s>
<s> from its holder he took his own canteen </s>
<s> the cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure </s>
<s> so alive </s>
<s> matsuo put the bottle to his own lips </s>
<s> the marine reached up a hand </s>
<s> matsuo shook his head </s>
<s> the marine blinked soon dropping his hand </s>
<s> not only had he no canteen but he lacked even the belt to hang one on </s>
<s> some odor made him lean over the man </s>
<s> he sniffed and recognized it </s>
<s> sake </s>
<s> so that had been his difficulty </s>
<s> drunk on sake he must have wandered off from his bivouac </s>
<s> the marine tried to roll on his right side and moaned </s>
<s> when he rolled on the left side propping on his left elbow matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over </s>
<s> awkwardly with one hand matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle </s>
<s> in the caves with other supplies they had kept cases of sake </s>
<s> the marine shut his eyes </s>
<s> he waited in his squat gripping the hair </s>
<s> every so often he turned the knife </s>
<s> its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight </s>
<s> the sun was noon high and matsuo perspired until his body was dripping </s>
<s> the man had thrown the left hand over his eyes </s>
<s> now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle </s>
<s> he must have saturated himself in the drink for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze </s>
<s> matsuo shook his head </s>
<s> strange </s>
<s> at last he reached for the knife </s>
<s> first he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes </s>
<s> the marine yelled and flung the hand away </s>
<s> matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat </s>
<s> burned the other cheek </s>
<s> burned each hand when they came groping again </s>
<s> the marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment </s>
<s> matsuo stood up </s>
<s> he dropped the knife in its scabbard hung the rifle behind a shoulder </s>
<s> the marine hands on cheeks rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach </s>
<s> he ceased weeping </s>
<s> matsuo walked toward his tree once glancing back </s>
<s> the marine was still </s>
<s> he would soon die </s>
<s> as matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow </s>
<s> in the jungle birds were mute while insects preserved only the monotony of living </s>
<s> someone called </s>
<s> it was the marine head lifted he strained and called </s>
<s> then he astonished matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat </s>
<s> he cupped his mouth and yelled </s>
<s> matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder </s>
<s> he aimed but listened </s>
<s> the man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container </s>
<s> he performed the act twice more and the begging in his tone grew more distinct </s>
<s> matsuo called </s>
<s> the marine nodded vigorously </s>
<s> matsuo laughed slung the rifle </s>
<s> the marine was a winehead </s>
<s> his superiors had said that all marines were depraved </s>
<s> the marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol </s>
<s> remembering his own thirst matsuo took out his water bottle </s>
<s> one swallow was all he would have </s>
<s> he was very thirsty but he must observe water discipline </s>
<s> his years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline </s>
<s> he began to uncap the bottle the rusty cap squealing on its threads </s>
<s> popping upright the marine waved both hands and shouted </s>
<s> of course it was water he really craved </s>
<s> down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out </s>
<s> the marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack </s>
<s> matsuo shook his head </s>
<s> he had no water for an enemy </s>
<s> he capped the bottle and replaced it </s>
<s> after all he had less reason to desire it than the marine </s>
<s> before much longer the marine quieted down </s>
<s> his head slumped </s>
<s> the upper part of his packet had stained dark </s>
<s> he reminded matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in china </s>
<s> in china it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform smudged blood-specked with the village burning about him and shells exploding </s>
<s> chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar </s>
<s> only blue throat and his gang stayed where they were </s>
<s> blue throat was slumped with his back against the bar elbows supporting his massive frame </s>
<s> he leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> he straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer </s>
<s> the stranger ignored him </s>
<s> blue throat winked at his six cronies </s>
<s> his gun was half drawn when he asked the question but the weapon never left its holster </s>
<s> his head snapped round and he reeled back crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling </s>
<s> tilghman leapt on to him dragged him upright and hit him again this time sending him careening against the bar </s>
<s> tilghman flung himself aside dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun </s>
<s> the colt roared twice and two men dropped writhing </s>
<s> a third shot doused the light </s>
<s> he fired again and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed </s>
<s> another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor </s>
<s> somebody brought a light </s>
<s> tilghman and his partner george rust herded the men into a corner </s>
<s> blue throat nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride rode out of town with the survivors of the fight </s>
<s> the prediction was correct </s>
<s> the reverend james doran had scarcely completed pat conyers last rites on boot hill in the township of petrie when shots were heard in the distance </s>
<s> billy tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle </s>
<s> blue throat who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship </s>
<s> it was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring ruthless gun-slinger and this was the time-honored wild west method of doing it </s>
<s> he rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to main street </s>
<s> the entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn </s>
<s> several were firing into the barn when billy tilghman arrived </s>
<s> he sized up the situation and shook his head </s>
<s> he called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom </s>
<s> billy returned with six sticks of dynamite </s>
<s> he slipped outside hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways </s>
<s> all he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through </s>
<s> billy tilghman did just that </s>
<s> within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters with every outlaw either dead or injured inside </s>
<s> though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts </s>
<s> he was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book </s>
<s> he saw the most action beat up more badmen with his bare fists broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other us marshal who lived before or after him </s>
<s> for fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the west </s>
<s> the deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship but because billy tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the west have remained almost unsung </s>
<s> citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century </s>
<s> led by bill doolin these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks making liberal use of their guns </s>
<s> tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove with the doolin gang </s>
<s> they bought rustled cattle from the outlaw kept him supplied with guns and ammunition harbored his men in their houses </s>
<s> billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers named ed dunn who lived at rock fort </s>
<s> it was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside </s>
<s> the only evidence of occupation came from the chimney which was belching out thick smoke </s>
<s> the two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door </s>
<s> leaving his rifle in the wagon tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it </s>
<s> there was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside </s>
<s> directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day </s>
<s> seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher ed dunn </s>
<s> tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire </s>
<s> suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck </s>
<s> along each side of the room were six tiered bunks each one screened off with a curtain </s>
<s> and projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles all trained on billy tilghman </s>
<s> the fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide </s>
<s> thinking fast tilghman never hesitated for one instant </s>
<s> he walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him </s>
<s> the rancher was trembling </s>
<s> resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes </s>
<s> all that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body </s>
<s> one false move on his part and he would be a dead man </s>
<s> he strolled back to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him </s>
<s> he left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of providence he had been allowed to come out alive </s>
<s> but he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon </s>
<s> if he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly </s>
<s> leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to neal brown </s>
<s> back in the house a hoodlum named red buck sore because billy had been allowed to leave unscathed jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then </s>
<s> wiley lynn a self-styled prohibition officer had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since </s>
<s> for several months now jack carter a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them had been haunted by a dream a vision of a woman </s>
<s> this woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she radiated warmth a sweet warmth </s>
<s> she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately </s>
<s> when she would do these things he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach </s>
<s> then he would run to the toilet behind the house </s>
<s> sometimes he did this three or four times a day for this woman was almost always with him </s>
<s> but they never said anything so he figured it was all right </s>
<s> he could not keep his eyes off her when at school </s>
<s> when he went home at night he took her with him in his mind and she did the things the anonymous woman used to do and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do </s>
<s> when he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh </s>
<s> tall blonde blue-eyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh starched summer dress </s>
<s> she would look at jack with that hidden something in her eyes and jack would see the woman and become breathless and a little sick </s>
<s> school began in august the hottest part of the year and for the first few days miss langford was very lenient with the children letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another </s>
<s> the first two or three days they went home early </s>
<s> all that is except jack </s>
<s> he hung around the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while miss langford straightened desks and put the room in order </s>
<s> he thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating </s>
<s> he jumped back ducked and ran crouching down the hill away from the school </s>
<s> then he slowed to a walk </s>
<s> the vision became even stronger now </s>
<s> he ate litle that morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate heartily </s>
<s> she said with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child </s>
<s> he felt a little sick at his stomach </s>
<s> and if you get sick ask the teacher to let you come home early </s>
<s> charles said grinning showing his huge yellow teeth </s>
<s> he considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him </s>
<s> charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the dixie highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school </s>
<s> jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were charles only apparent interest </s>
<s> his heart beat faster </s>
<s> he said lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with charles </s>
<s> miss langford in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals without socks was out there with them trying to get them inside </s>
<s> the children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse </s>
<s> jack watched miss langford all morning </s>
<s> he could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles had said that morning about margaret rider </s>
<s> occasionally he would look across the aisle at margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress sitting in the sixth-grade row and he could hardly believe she would do what charles had said she did </s>
<s> at noontime remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys except charles went off out the road to play ball </s>
<s> he asked charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse </s>
<s> presently she came out of the schoolhouse </s>
<s> they played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap </s>
<s> then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over her head </s>
<s> when her hand touched his fire went through jack and he felt weak but he managed somehow to get her on her feet </s>
<s> he thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go </s>
<s> one of the little girls said </s>
<s> when he came back to the schoolhouse his mind was made up </s>
<s> he simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class </s>
<s> that should do it he thought because miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school work </s>
<s> to his surprise his plan worked perfectly </s>
<s> and so when the others stampeded out that afternoon jack remained docilely in his seat near a window looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed going home </s>
<s> he scarcely saw them </s>
<s> on the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise </s>
<s> the youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman </s>
<s> lithe and muscular he had well-molded features and his light color told of the european ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family </s>
<s> col henri garvier was one of new orleans most important and enlightened slave owners </s>
<s> he chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start </s>
<s> the slaves ran gaily to the center of congo square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called johnny no-name </s>
<s> johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum </s>
<s> he showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy </s>
<s> the drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the louisiana slave compounds </s>
<s> the dance was of haitian origin </s>
<s> he was possessive in his manner and though a slave obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners </s>
<s> delphine was a pace-setter in high society </s>
<s> the slender handsome fellow was called dandy brandon by the other slaves </s>
<s> he was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race </s>
<s> shy actually he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields in carriages and in boathouses </s>
<s> this young slave was therefore quite unprepared when delphine lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near </s>
<s> the woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection </s>
<s> come a bit closer </s>
<s> he gaped at madame lalaurie and sniffed the paris perfume which emanated from her </s>
<s> then he smiled shyly </s>
<s> mrs lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage </s>
<s> lifting her skirts she climbed in never relinquishing her grip on his arm </s>
<s> the woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor </s>
<s> once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees </s>
<s> satisfied at last and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced delphine that dandy was capable of learning new arts she opened the window and called to her liveried driver </s>
<s> this was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling shaggy eyebrows </s>
<s> if the old fool argues about the price tell him i shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer </s>
<s> prieur has gout and depends on louis pills and bleedings </s>
<s> aristide devol the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native sierra leone smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat </s>
<s> his bold eyes raked the woman and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner </s>
<s> the coachman said softly </s>
<s> such delicate beauty such fine flesh </s>
<s> the tall coachman walked off briskly in search of alexander prieur </s>
<s> dr louis lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion </s>
<s> dandy curiosity overcoming his apprehensions peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle </s>
<s> he saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head </s>
<s> dr lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses </s>
<s> delphine presented her cheek for a kiss and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster </s>
<s> i want the room in the attic prepared for him he is a most unusual lad quite precocious in many ways </s>
<s> the physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave </s>
<s> had dandy been older or wiser instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the lalauries tender care if he valued his life </s>
<s> besides her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth </s>
<s> also he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony </s>
<s> so dandy brandon trustingly entered the house with delphine lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home </s>
<s> airless and dingy though it was the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at bayou st john </s>
<s> it was just as well that the ignorant dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening for the room was to become his prison cell </s>
<s> a stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms and delphine circulated graciously among her guests chatting airily of the forthcoming races the latest fashions from paris and louisiana politics </s>
<s> suddenly there was a commotion upstairs a despairing boyish shriek and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase </s>
<s> it was dandy brandon clad only in a bloody loincloth emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him </s>
<s> his pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition </s>
<s> these were the last words he ever uttered </s>
<s> convulsively he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of senator gaston berche crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore </s>
<s> dr louis lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead </s>
<s> the ball broke up in confusion </s>
<s> guests stared with horror at madame lalaurie and made speedy departures </s>
<s> delphine stood like stone her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse </s>
<s> it was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest </s>
<s> after i paid monsieur prieur for dandy i brought him home but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night </s>
<s> how he returned in such a ghastly condition or why i cannot say </s>
<s> he must have fallen in with evil companions for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced </s>
<s> ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die </s>
<s> moreover runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in new orleans dives </s>
<s> mrs victor dominique socially prominent and a neighbor of the lalauries chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight </s>
<s> she was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back </s>
<s> the bleeding girl was tiring fast </s>
<s> the coachman and delphine were gaining on her as she raced down perdido street </s>
<s> they have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw </s>
<s> he had been conning the freights for a long long time now </s>
<s> ever since the hooch and the trouble with the quartet and midge and the child </s>
<s> ever since all that </s>
<s> it had been a very long time that had no form and no end </s>
<s> out and out and never to return again </s>
<s> till one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint had been killed the last beat had been rapped </s>
<s> that was the day it ended </s>
<s> the freight car was cold early in the morning </s>
<s> he was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina </s>
<s> he held his elbows away from his body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly </s>
<s> the train slowed at a road crossing and the big door slid open </s>
<s> the boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor </s>
<s> a little thing but the right twist for the action that counted </s>
<s> hot that was the word hot </s>
<s> a poet yet </s>
<s> his thoughts for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and the long legs were less than poetic however </s>
<s> zingggg-o </s>
<s> then the boy straight-armed himself up twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting </s>
<s> he was less to see but feathertop took him in too just to keep the records straight </s>
<s> feathertop interrupted standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants </s>
<s> they whirled and saw him standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall </s>
<s> he was big and filthy and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes </s>
<s> he held the black plastic kazoo lightly </s>
<s> the girl smiled and started forward </s>
<s> the boy yanked her back hard tugging her off her feet and gathered her into the crook of his arm </s>
<s> this guy was strictly from outsville </s>
<s> but nowhere </s>
<s> his head came up and he said it defiantly </s>
<s> feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand </s>
<s> these two were going to be easy pickins </s>
<s> that was gonna be fun collecting </s>
<s> but not just yet </s>
<s> feathertop was a connoisseur </s>
<s> he liked to savor his meat before he tasted it </s>
<s> he grinned at them wolfishly </s>
<s> feathertop aimed a finger at him </s>
<s> she started to move toward the hay bags dragging the reluctant cappy behind her </s>
<s> feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim trim legs as she walked to the bags and tucked them beneath her smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle </s>
<s> he cleared his throat </s>
<s> he had it all doped of course </s>
<s> kitty inquired politely </s>
<s> he mused </s>
<s> they lapsed into silence and the freight wallowed up a hill scooted down the other side shaking and clanking to itself </s>
<s> ernie found it immensely funny </s>
<s> the boy scowled at him and the girl looked shocked </s>
<s> she snapped at him </s>
<s> why we got dinner right here </s>
<s> cappy looked wary but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar </s>
<s> ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag </s>
<s> he took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal a deep pot of thin metal some sheets of newspaper a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it </s>
<s> he put the charcoal in the pot lit the paper with the matches and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot </s>
<s> he reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners </s>
<s> he ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid three dogs on the tin foil </s>
<s> almost immediately they began to sizzle </s>
<s> he looked up and grinned </s>
<s> when they had licked the last of the wieners taste from their fingers they settled back and cappy offered ernie a cigarette </s>
<s> nice kid ernie thought too bad </s>
<s> ernie asked </s>
<s> cappy looked down at his wide hands and did not reply </s>
<s> this time even she did not answer </s>
<s> she looked down at her hands too </s>
<s> it was all my fault </s>
<s> cappy raged at himself </s>
<s> ernie nodded </s>
<s> this was a slightly different matter </s>
<s> he remembered midge and the child </s>
<s> a time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out </s>
<s> oh crap </s>
<s> he thought pull out of it old son </s>
<s> these are just another couple of characters to roll </s>
<s> what they got you get </s>
<s> now forget all this other </s>
<s> ernie offered taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket </s>
<s> the answer came from the open door of the boxcar </s>
<s> from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train had slowed on the grade </s>
<s> ernie stared at the man </s>
<s> he was big </s>
<s> real big with shoulders out to here and hair all over him like a grizzly </s>
<s> road gang ernie thought </s>
<s> the big man asked again taking a step into the boxcar </s>
<s> ernie hesitated a moment </s>
<s> this character could break him in half </s>
<s> he guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder </s>
<s> the man stalked toward them his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring </s>
<s> he took the bottle with undue belligerence and making sucking noises with his thick lips drained it completely </s>
<s> he threw his head back closed his eyes and belched ferociously </s>
<s> he belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the open door </s>
<s> he had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it </s>
<s> he advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car </s>
<s> the newcomer stalked toward them and kitty shied back her hand to her mouth </s>
<s> her scream split up the silence of the car accompanied by the rattling of the freight and then cappy came off the floor his legs driving him hard </s>
<s> the kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump </s>
<s> they went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs </s>
<s> the kid showed for an instant and his arm was cocked back </s>
<s> then they were tumbling again and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier and came up with a vicious switchblade </s>
<s> the blade came out with a snick </s>
<s> kitty screamed insanely and her face was white </s>
<s> help him </s>
<s> they neither liked nor disliked the old man </s>
<s> the old man was unimportant </s>
<s> yet if he were not there they would have missed him as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early june </s>
<s> or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights </s>
<s> or the bay of female dogs in heat </s>
<s> they never called him by name although he had one </s>
<s> but here he was just signore or the old man </s>
<s> but this was not unusual because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders </s>
<s> youth obeyed when commanded </s>
<s> it went to church on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession </s>
<s> the only thing unusual about the old man had long since happened </s>
<s> but the past was dead here as the present was dead </s>
<s> once the old man had had a wife </s>
<s> and once she too ignored him </s>
<s> in one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase </s>
<s> the way she strutted down the street the old man would have been blind not to have noticed both </s>
<s> without looking at him without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of her she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars rode away in it and never came back </s>
<s> not that one </s>
<s> she gave herself fancy airs </s>
<s> they had slapped their thighs </s>
<s> calloused fingers caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted never to be tweezed away </s>
<s> but if the old man even thought about his wife now nobody cared a fig </s>
<s> his voice had not commanded her to stop </s>
<s> it had not questioned why </s>
<s> the women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell </s>

<s> there seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to drexel street and his back in opposition to the church behind him </s>
<s> for all he saw or cared to see this could have been a town in italy not the outskirts of philadelphia </s>

<s> this place was hatred to him just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness </s>
<s> to him they were one and the same </s>
<s> sameness for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city </s>
<s> sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash </s>
<s> it slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches </s>
<s> it swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors </s>
<s> even the stable-garage which housed nothing now but the scent of rot had a lawn before it </s>
<s> and the coffee shop on drexel street where the men spent their evenings and sundays playing cards had a rose hedge beneath its window </s>
<s> the hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it </s>
<s> only one house on the street had no lawn before it </s>
<s> it squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade </s>
<s> above it from a second-story showroom wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood </s>
<s> love and hatred and fear were one here shaded only by fig trees and grape vines </s>
<s> and the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch </s>
<s> the old man silently fed upon these streets </s>
<s> they kept him alive waiting </s>
<s> waiting for what and for whom only he could tell and would not </s>
<s> it was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself but it was not yet time to pay the price </s>
<s> he was holding out for something </s>
<s> he was determined to hold out </s>
<s> neither did he care that aunt rose provided for him </s>
<s> to him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep </s>
<s> when he would be a man he would be a rich man </s>
<s> he would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning </s>
<s> he would not carry a brief case </s>
<s> nor would he work at all </s>
<s> he would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step </s>
<s> he could do that when he would be a man </s>
<s> he called to his sister on the porch above the steps </s>
<s> she was only ten months older than he </s>
<s> laura did not answer him </s>
<s> she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence brushing and drying her wet gilded hair in the sun </s>
<s> one lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking torn pales </s>
<s> all the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her chest </s>
<s> her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii </s>
<s> it was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours </s>
<s> the eyes blue and always somewhat downcast possessed a sullen quality </s>
<s> even though the boy could not see them he knew they were clouded by distance </s>
<s> he was never sure they fully took him in </s>
<s> but the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it </s>
<s> and as for his pipe if he wanted to smoke one nobody would stop him </s>
<s> not even laura </s>
<s> above the tongue an aged yellow eye sallow and time-cast encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin stared unfalteringly at him </s>
<s> but the goat would not </s>
<s> soothing it with his hand knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch </s>
<s> pompeii rolled over </s>
<s> his head undulated gradually covering space to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats </s>
<s> with his mouth opened wide he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light earthy taste of it </s>
<s> above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud </s>
<s> its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane </s>
<s> the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over him sensing something portentous in it </s>
<s> there would be time enough perhaps the old man reassured himself to pay the devil his due </s>
<s> time enough to give up his soul </s>

<s> in two months she became a fat highly social baby with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head </s>
<s> she stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food </s>
<s> she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her </s>
<s> there was the daily round of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating </s>
<s> worry had a great deal to do with it </s>
<s> maggie and stuart pored over figures every night trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more </s>

<s> the cold settled like a tangible pall over the mile high city locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance </s>

<s> the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices outside newspaper buildings in parks in relief lines outside government agencies </s>
<s> there never had been a need felt for such facilities </s>
<s> that kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries protected by discriminatory freight rates </s>
<s> the east was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression dragging the west along </s>
<s> and now the east was creating government agencies for which the west doubtless would have to pay </s>
<s> shivering people talked and argued </s>
<s> all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done </s>
<s> something had to be done </s>
<s> it was the theme song of millions of american people their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government </s>
<s> something had to be done </s>
<s> the abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day </s>
<s> something had to be done about the furnace the fuel bills the washing machine the doctor and dentist bills about making money stretch for food for the mortgage for taxes for shoes for half soles for overshoes for clothes for the new leaks in the roof for gas and light bills </s>
<s> about keeping warm about keeping well about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once twice fifty times a day </s>
<s> the abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold </s>
<s> cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up under doors around loosened window frames from the sleeping porches the attic from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof </s>
<s> it was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive </s>

<s> they lived mainly in the kitchen </s>
<s> grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days and it was the way people ought to live only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to </s>
<s> eugenia hated being cold worse than anything and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin </s>
<s> she said to maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever </s>
<s> they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out and that she hoped to die in privacy like a christian and if the lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way </s>

<s> for the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about gunny going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall </s>

<s> tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick he suggested </s>
<s> the chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came she was sure </s>

<s> night after night he stayed with gunny in the dead of winter rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house </s>

<s> doc dunne and miss sis had come </s>

<s> she hoped they were well </s>
<s> he was downright worried about her but there was one more thing he could try </s>
<s> he swung in through his own wide gateway </s>
<s> doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman </s>
<s> she found herself wishing an old wish that she had told doaty she was running away that she had left something more behind her than the loving sorry note and her best garnet pin </s>
<s> perhaps doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel </s>
<s> there had been more to know about hetty inevitably and most of it unfavorable </s>
<s> adelia was the good one or if not always good less frequently tempted </s>
<s> in winter in the city there had been the maneret school which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge </s>
<s> there had been lessons in french from a small polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils </s>
<s> there had been supper parties and teas fetes and little balls mama small and pretty and gay and papa enormously jocular enormously possessive the sun around which the blackwell planets revolved </s>
<s> mama had died before the corruption of the family circle the interruption of charles </s>
<s> mama was vulnerable </s>
<s> one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her </s>
<s> but i would have gone anyway thought henrietta </s>
<s> she had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice </s>
<s> perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice </s>
<s> she turned on her side finding the idea oppressive </s>
<s> impossible to imagine adelia feeling so about anyone </s>
<s> no temptation no sin </s>
<s> a curious thought to end a curious night </s>
<s> everything must wait upon this mission this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards </s>
<s> she closed her eyes remembering the small french cemetery enclosed by stone walls </s>
<s> it had always seemed to rain there and even the grass was gray </s>
<s> after the sad impatient moment waiting for comfort which could not come she slipped out of bed and went to the open window </s>
<s> the garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness </s>
<s> leaning out she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle one not quite come to bloom one just beyond it </s>
<s> on a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds like a summer valentine a bird balanced and sang nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music a little engine of song </s>
<s> feeling suddenly neat and subdued she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs </s>
<s> rosa unbelievably was not yet up and about reassurance that rosa was human </s>
<s> feeling protective toward this sleeping being henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot </s>
<s> the poodle came gleefully to henrietta and begged for the flowers supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws </s>
<s> henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for doaty </s>
<s> she sounded so exactly like doaty that henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home </s>
<s> folly danced eager for whatever lay beyond the door </s>
<s> to a blackwell there was only one church </s>
<s> the cemetery slumbered just behind it and the way lay through the village and close to the sea </s>
<s> for the first time in thirty years henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity </s>
<s> she smiled and bowed recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child </s>
<s> now some of the acknowledgments were cautious but all were interested </s>
<s> an old man sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him gave her a more than reflective look as she passed the sap still plainly rising in his branches </s>
<s> on an impulse she turned back and said good morning </s>
<s> he cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time </s>
<s> he then offered his own estimate of the weather which was unenthusiastic </s>
<s> he scowled at her flowers </s>
<s> he regarded her with rising hope </s>
<s> he straightened himself soldierly against the wall and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots </s>
<s> his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text </s>
<s> henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense </s>
<s> he looked up at her sharply </s>
<s> she did suddenly through the link of memory with his father old titus who must have been in his nineties when henrietta ran away </s>
<s> he had never spoken once to the awed sisters but his son had been friendly a big fellow of fifty or more a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea </s>
<s> it must be that son who sat before her now shriveled to half his size and half his senses </s>
<s> ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man </s>
<s> he gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly </s>
<s> well she had not come back to great island to be understood praised or condemned </s>
<s> she had come to make her peace with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow </s>
<s> she started to move away just as a woman came out of the cottage a big-boned drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress </s>
<s> she smiled vaguely at henrietta and spoke to the old man </s>
<s> he beat the air with his stick and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones </s>
<s> his grand-daughter sighed </s>
<s> henrietta nodded </s>
<s> how much they knew about her </s>
<s> he mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength </s>
<s> there was a gabble of voices from indoors young hungry sounds like cats after fish and a burst of swearing from the old man </s>
<s> at the edge of the field the wild rolling land took over dotted with fat round bushes like sheep </s>
<s> they were covered with tiny white blossoms their scant roots clawing at the stony ground and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry </s>
<s> the air was full of sounds too but placid ones a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky </s>
<s> she felt mindless walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to doaty </s>
<s> she sat down on the nearest fallen with age and gray with sea-damp her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss </s>
<s> a small rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb the only angel in the cemetery </s>
<s> she remembered suddenly a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and adelia having dared each other had stolen out of their great safe house and come here hand in hand hoping and fearing ghosts </s>
<s> the momoyama family had come from miyagi prefecture in the northeast of the main japanese island of honshu where there are still traces of the mysterious ainu strain </s>
<s> the ainus were a primitive people already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the japanese came from southern asia </s>
<s> apparently they were of caucasian blood </s>
<s> they had white skins and blue eyes </s>
<s> all their men were bearded and many of their women were beautiful </s>
<s> a pitiful few of them are left now to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the american indians </s>
<s> most of them have been assimilated but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the south </s>
<s> tommy momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions </s>
<s> she was taller than most japanese girls and had the exquisitely willowy form of the japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall </s>
<s> her nose was higher of bridge her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong </s>
<s> her mouth soft and full was something for any man to dream about </s>
<s> she had black eyes long and intriguingly tilted and the way she walked was melody </s>
<s> she had been in japan just one week </s>
<s> it was an alien land and she hated it intensely </s>
<s> anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors </s>
<s> there was nothing wrong with her job </s>
<s> tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward </s>
<s> tommy was interested in psychiatry because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients </s>
<s> but she suffered in her off-duty hours </s>
<s> such as now when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the officers club having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime </s>
<s> she had changed into a cocktail dress and the whole evening should have been before her but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck </s>
<s> sooner or later all the gray navy ships came in here </s>
<s> if tommy sat long enough she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long beach </s>
<s> and she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there </s>
<s> she felt rather than saw the approach of the good-looking young man </s>
<s> he came through from the fleet bar which was stag with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried </s>
<s> when he saw tommy sitting alone the tinkling sound stopped </s>
<s> he was perhaps a trifle tipsy having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted and consequently out of practice </s>
<s> he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in hong kong and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant </s>
<s> there was a fifty-fifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different </s>
<s> it was as if foreign duty implied and excused license </s>
<s> then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different </s>
<s> he said turning on what was meant to be charm </s>
<s> tommy said out of her cold rage </s>
<s> the nice-looking young officer fell back on his heels open-mouthed and blushing </s>
<s> at least he had the decency to blush she thought </s>
<s> tommy interrupted furiously </s>
<s> then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture and dropped into navy slang </s>
<s> he muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool </s>
<s> the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy </s>
<s> she felt like a fool too </s>
<s> there are spanish girls who look like tommy momoyama brunettes with a moorish hint of the orient in their faces </s>
<s> now having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for tommy was being humiliated at every turn </s>
<s> she looked around self-consciously </s>
<s> for one cup of coffee </s>
<s> two other japanese girls were sitting at the tables both quite pretty and well groomed </s>
<s> one was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander </s>
<s> the other was with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children </s>
<s> she told herself rebelliously and with pride i am an american </s>
<s> and so she was and would remain </s>
<s> but she was learning that so long as she was in this country and wore civilian dress in the club there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken english </s>
<s> there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese </s>
<s> after coming to america her parents had spoken only english </s>
<s> one thing was becoming increasingly sure </s>
<s> she had been sent to the wrong place for duty </s>
<s> there was more to service in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward </s>
<s> one had to have friends and a congenial life in after-duty hours </s>
<s> now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar </s>
<s> it was terribly off key and poorly done and tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing but all at once she felt lonesome and put-upon </s>
<s> she finished her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check </s>
<s> she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated </s>
<s> eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion </s>
<s> back in her living quarters at the hospital she took bicarbonate of soda and sulked </s>
<s> then after a while she went to her mirror </s>
<s> it was all true </s>
<s> she certainly looked japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young men </s>
<s> and still they did not have to be so crude in their approach </s>
<s> there was a letter to write to her mother and she tried to make its tone cheerful </s>
<s> and tomorrow she would take time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown </s>
<s> actually this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water </s>
<s> but the beer hall riot in subic had been unusual too and walt perry was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing </s>
<s> in his opinion doc had not grown up </s>
<s> the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief </s>
<s> there had never been a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up </s>
<s> he had come into the navy too young with the image of the fun-loving guns appleby before him </s>
<s> he remained young at heart with an overdeveloped sense of humor </s>
<s> he was doing thirty years and the navy would take care of him </s>
<s> the job security enjoyed by doc doolittle and nearly all members of the armed forces is a wonderful thing </s>
<s> actually all a man in uniform has to do is to get by </s>
<s> he may not rise to the heights but he can get by and eventually be retired </s>
<s> doc had been under restriction to the ship since the bustard left subic </s>
<s> this deprived him of liberty in hong kong but he told boats mccafferty that hong kong was a book he had read before and the navy would always bring him there again some day </s>
<s> at yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of the base because walt perry being thoughtful knew that doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply base </s>
<s> this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment and suited him quite well </s>
<s> there were two things he wanted to do inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the naval base and visit an old shipmate </s>
<s> a telephone line had been hooked up to connect the ship with the base exchange </s>
<s> after supper doc called whitey gresham who was now a lieutenant and had a family </s>
<s> whitey exclaimed with true affection </s>
<s> we live down by the base commissary </s>
<s> he threw a smart salute at the gangway went up the dock and turned down the wide street in front of the petty officers club </s>
<s> he considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk </s>
<s> then there was exercise boating and hiking which was not only good for you but also made you more virile the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted </s>
<s> there was swimming over at the riverside hotel but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog </s>
<s> the telephone rang </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> he laughed and laughed </s>
<s> buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest </s>
<s> when owen was finally rid of him there was a timid rap at the door </s>
<s> ahah he thought a lush divorcee at last </s>
<s> probably saw me in the lobby </s>
<s> he was disappointed to find a nervous scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door </s>
<s> she frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons </s>
<s> she said semi-professionally </s>
<s> we call them lay-sisters and they go among the eskimos making friends and bringing the light </s>
<s> smug owen thought smug and sappy </s>
<s> there was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye </s>
<s> it gave her a lewd winking effect </s>
<s> she asked winking wildly </s>
<s> she smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion </s>
<s> forebearing owen kept his peace </s>
<s> several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated trying to close the door a little and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice </s>
<s> he asked curiously </s>
<s> every day i visit a different hotel </s>
<s> i do this work all on my own because i understand the difficulties and i want to help these lay-sisters </s>
<s> mrs gertrude parker drew back </s>
<s> it sounded silly </s>
<s> more people were passing </s>
<s> he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation </s>
<s> they must be freezing up there now </s>
<s> she looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race </s>
<s> she stood indecisively for a moment then walked down the hall </s>
<s> he heard her knocking on another door </s>
<s> it took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself </s>
<s> then he realized he was hungry </s>
<s> he showered shaved dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast </s>
<s> on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail </s>
<s> there was a check from his company and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued </s>
<s> he ate breakfast in a sullen mood but afterwards when he walked out onto virginia street he felt braced </s>
<s> he looked off to the crest of the sierras still white-topped </s>
<s> the glisten of the truckee river made a wide spangle </s>
<s> he felt suddenly elated adventurous </s>
<s> with any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot </s>
<s> the tables were all spinning the dice rattling the bar crowded </s>
<s> just to test himself he played roulette for quarters on his old combination five and seventeen and within an hour he had won surprisingly twenty dollars </s>
<s> the way was opening up </s>
<s> when the management brought around champagne the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach </s>
<s> the golden calf was dimly lit with shaded neon </s>
<s> they all had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming who automatically turned the cards hardly caring what showed up </s>
<s> the mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons who appeared much more animated than the gamblers </s>
<s> the women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance while the men were stern but hopeful </s>
<s> all of course except the donner party who were bent on starving to death </s>
<s> he sat down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes </s>
<s> she sighed a dirty word and left </s>
<s> owen was surprised to see mrs gertrude parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance </s>
<s> she sat down and played two slots at once looking grim as if bested by mechanical devices and owen felt sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support </s>
<s> he was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables </s>
<s> owen asked </s>
<s> i once trained a horse for hoot gibson but nothing like sparky </s>
<s> five came up while owen was listening to the wrangler and he neglected to play a loss of ten dollars </s>
<s> this proved conclusively that the wrangler was a jinx so he walked on down to hurrays an even more glorified gambling den than the golden calf </s>
<s> when he looked in the back mrs gertrude parker was marking keno cards </s>
<s> his adventurous spirit had waned </s>
<s> he studied the pistol exhibition that hurrays featured as an added attraction </s>
<s> he ogled a long redhead with green eyes but she was a shill with her money in front of her </s>
<s> he had no great prejudice against shills </s>
<s> it just seemed such a dry run </s>
<s> there was no cash around </s>
<s> everyone was flipping silver dollars </s>
<s> the management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points </s>
<s> he wondered if he might bag a tourist but they looked frightened of him </s>
<s> he passed two brides both wearing orchids and they made him feel a little sad </s>
<s> owen found buzz watching chuck-a-luck </s>
<s> buzz had on a hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil and dark glasses </s>
<s> he was shorter and fatter than owen who felt good standing next to him </s>
<s> he started out as a stickman then became a pit boss until the club found him crossroading </s>

<s> naval procedure he thought had its moments of grim humor </s>
<s> philip spencer had cold-bloodedly planned the murder of his captain yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address </s>
<s> during the morning hours it became clear that the arrest of spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the somers </s>
<s> those named in the greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty so as to be near spencer watching an opportunity to communicate with him </s>
<s> hostile glances were flashed at both alexander and gansevoort </s>
<s> he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot </s>
<s> he saw the dangers not the glories of being identified as a mutineer </s>
<s> there was a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished to see the captain </s>
<s> heiser breathless and wild-eyed brought the chilling news that the handspikes heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places </s>
<s> an african knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley and green </s>
<s> he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind him </s>
<s> a glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away </s>
<s> the aimless milling about of what had been a well-trained well-organized crew struck alexander with horror </s>
<s> he bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched too the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction </s>
<s> i saw him myself and it was done after consultation with cromwell </s>
<s> and it was clear that adrien was not mistaken for both small and cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till philip spencer had given the signal to obey </s>
<s> then with disappointment evident upon their faces they moved to the work </s>
<s> alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed </s>
<s> when the mast was raised alexander gave the order for small and cromwell to be placed under arrest and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the somers </s>
<s> one of the missing handspikes came out of its hiding place after midshipman tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by seaman wilson </s>
<s> tillotson had reported the man to gansevoort and an hour later with back turned had been attacked by wilson brandishing the weapon </s>
<s> wilson shackled and snarling was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by green mckee and mckinley </s>
<s> not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny </s>
<s> in the tiny cabin alexander met with gansevoort heiser and wales to speak and to listen </s>
<s> to have the greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed </s>
<s> then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the united states they will be punished but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order </s>
<s> they are about to do so at any moment as it is </s>
<s> all that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead </s>
<s> as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from spencer we are going to be rushed </s>
<s> the instinct of discipline has been lost </s>
<s> implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands </s>
<s> alexander said </s>
<s> those of us present the perry brothers deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the somers </s>
<s> and when he was alone again in the cabin alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept for he knew full well what must be done what in the end would be done </s>
<s> and when he did when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor he knew he would lose forever the navy to which he had dedicated his soul </s>
<s> he who had tried so hard who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer </s>
<s> it came to him as he wept there aboard the somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven </s>
<s> it was given or it was not given </s>
<s> and alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had and he felt no shame </s>
<s> another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist </s>
<s> it was for love that he had served the navy </s>
<s> to have someday that love returned was what he had lived for </s>
<s> now the hope was gone </s>
<s> yes he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price </s>
<s> dear god at what a price </s>
<s> and after a while he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity </s>
<s> stern-faced he inspected the prisoners satisfying himself that they were clean well fed and comfortable within reason </s>
<s> the prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger </s>
<s> only cromwell the giant boatswain was mild-mannered and respectful </s>
<s> before god i swear i am innocent </s>
<s> he leaned closer to alexander squinting up at him from the deck </s>
<s> now spencer seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy spoke </s>
<s> alexander shifted his gaze to spencer </s>
<s> the calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend cromwell </s>
<s> alexander knew spencer too well to think him naive or thick-skulled </s>
<s> and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognized a kinship with spencer </s>
<s> here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable </s>
<s> there was good fortune and there was bad and philip spencer in handcuffs and ankle irons knew it to be a truth </s>
<s> he expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune </s>
<s> the red-haired captain towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer </s>
<s> this tragic lad had forged his own shackles </s>
<s> but he could not have done so could not have found the way had fortune favored him </s>
<s> his eyes went back to contemplation of the sea </s>
<s> and though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth still it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell </s>
<s> the boatswain was as guilty as any </s>
<s> it was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom where a class of apprentices awaited him </s>
<s> this was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized </s>
<s> rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the torah </s>
<s> bits of trash lay in the roadway </s>
<s> the air smelled warmish and foul </s>
<s> a young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides </s>
<s> he wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material dark trousers and black boots with buckles </s>
<s> his black hat with its wide brim high crown and fur trim rode high </s>
<s> with his head erect he approached not glancing at us and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead </s>
<s> he had a pinkish-white complexion a small straight nose a short black beard and tightly curled paot </s>
<s> i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms </s>
<s> the girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings </s>
<s> i turned and watched him stride down the center of the road </s>
<s> his hands were swinging at his sides and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and pivoting on his heel he entered an old stone building </s>
<s> rachel had seen me watching the young man </s>
<s> she smiled </s>
<s> i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside rachel </s>
<s> she led me into a twisting side alley </s>
<s> the dirty discolored buildings looked boarded up and their few windows stood high above our heads </s>
<s> rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings </s>
<s> we entered one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor </s>
<s> an old man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat baggy trousers and a black skullcap greeted us </s>
<s> rachel talked to him </s>
<s> he nodded clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch and flicked glances at me </s>
<s> i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were bare-armed but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor </s>
<s> his toes pointed out toward the walls </s>
<s> he stopped in front of a door placed a finger on his lips and still peering down into his beard pushed open the door to a classroom </s>
<s> we stepped inside </s>
<s> he left us </s>
<s> little boys crowded together on long wooden benches and in the center of the room sat the teacher </s>
<s> his black beard dripped down over the front of his coat </s>
<s> one white hand poised a stick above his desk </s>
<s> rapping the stick against the desk </s>
<s> the little boys shrilled out a yiddish translation or interpretation of the five books of moses which they had previously chanted in hebrew </s>
<s> they chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick </s>
<s> each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of europe </s>
<s> the boys were tiny </s>
<s> they had large bright eyes the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces </s>
<s> they bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher </s>
<s> since they did not glance curiously at us once i guessed that there was a penalty for distraction </s>
<s> the guttural language from the ghetto stopped </s>
<s> the teacher plunged the children into a new portion this time in hebrew rapping the stick incessantly </s>
<s> one boy who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles </s>
<s> his tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders </s>
<s> in the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap </s>
<s> his head barely rose above the table </s>
<s> i stared at him for a long time </s>
<s> he did not return my interest </s>
<s> my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys </s>
<s> some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago </s>
<s> they singsonged the portion at the teacher who accompanied them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick </s>
<s> the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake </s>
<s> i could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair </s>
<s> his body pitched back and forth on the bench </s>
<s> his front teeth were missing </s>
<s> i shuddered and backed out of the room </s>
<s> rachel followed looked at me and clucked with her tongue </s>
<s> we walked down the cool hall silently </s>
<s> from behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer </s>
<s> i rubbed my hands together </s>
<s> they had turned numb and prickly in the classroom </s>
<s> the old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps </s>
<s> he glanced down into his beard and muttered something in yiddish </s>
<s> she passed by him </s>
<s> i reached into the pocket of my skirt fingered ten pruta and dropped the coin </s>
<s> then i picked it up again and handed it to the old man </s>
<s> he thanked me </s>
<s> i grinned at rachel </s>
<s> i said </s>
<s> she smiled to herself </s>
<s> when we were fighting a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass </s>
<s> i was amazed </s>
<s> you had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home </s>
<s> you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal </s>
<s> i was american </s>
<s> you had to know also that you were going to fail </s>
<s> all of it might have been heroic but they had done it in the wrong place </s>
<s> i resented them </s>
<s> rachel faced me </s>
<s> her bright eyes were twinkling </s>
<s> your mother hated this way of life </s>
<s> rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth </s>
<s> but when she saw the children you have just visited she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country in the kibbutzim </s>
<s> she loved the children </s>
<s> she was a strange woman your mother </s>
<s> when she loved it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved </s>
<s> nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted </s>
<s> she stayed here to work for aliah </s>
<s> for many immigrants for many children the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your mother </s>
<s> rachel grinned slyly </s>
<s> she took it with her wherever she went </s>
<s> she chose it </s>
<s> and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people </s>
<s> she was most strange woman </s>
<s> ready to follow her impulse </s>
<s> your mother wanted to bring children to israel so that they could leave their ghettos </s>
<s> here they did not need to be in ghettos </s>
<s> if she could not take the children out of this section at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms </s>
<s> rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace </s>
<s> the soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones </s>
<s> she pursed her lips then clamped them together so tightly that i thought she was angry with me </s>
<s> but she sighed and her face relaxed </s>
<s> she had good friends here people who liked her </s>
<s> who loved her </s>
<s> but she had to go out and hurt herself </s>
<s> there was a man here in town </s>
<s> he helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted </s>
<s> she worked very hard </s>
<s> there was a refugee who was able to come here because of her </s>
<s> he came with his son </s>
<s> at first i thought they were relatives of your mother but it was not so </s>
<s> this refugee was a middle-aged man a big handsome man with a strut to his walk as i have never before seen </s>
<s> he had the black numerals on his arm so he had been branded in a concentration camp </s>
<s> yet he walked like a young man </s>
<s> often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one </s>
<s> then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of europe </s>
<s> all his family was dead except for his son </s>
<s> your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off and she would send him home to his son </s>
<s> he loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him </s>
<s> a few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed </s>
<s> she ran from a little group of us </s>
<s> we were sitting together talking </s>
<s> rachel paused </s>
<s> it was silent in the stone alley </s>
<s> rachel gave me a direct bright-eyed look </s>
<s> he said she would only hurt herself </s>
<s> he complained to me once that i must talk to her </s>
<s> when i did she shrugged her shoulders and said that reuveni wanted her to marry him </s>
<s> i asked her if she would and she said she would not </s>
<s> he had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him </s>
<s> anyway i did not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged himself </s>
<s> she came to me one day </s>
<s> she was pale and skinny </s>
<s> she was terribly alone </s>
<s> and she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to reuveni and accepted his proposal </s>
<s> but now he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her </s>
<s> he would never let her harm herself again </s>
<s> for one whole week he never let her stay alone </s>
<s> she let him lead her around </s>
<s> he took her to a doctor for she was run down nervous did not care where she was </s>
<s> reuveni took her with him wherever he went </s>
<s> he did not let her talk to people </s>
<s> he did not let her choose her own food </s>
<s> she was limp and beaten from her loss </s>
<s> she did not care </s>
<s> the two of them against the world </s>
<s> that had been how she imagined it </s>
<s> for when he began to talk and dream all at the same time making his plans as he went she had begun dreaming too </s>
<s> but now the dream was over </s>
<s> the big waking up had happened </s>
<s> she thought </s>
<s> he had taken her all right </s>
<s> wednesday nights after youth fellowship </s>
<s> and the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when gratt went out for ice the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened </s>
<s> and gratt shafer would be in memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would just like everybody knew all along </s>
<s> like mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and toonker burkette back in his office yanking out teeth like they all knew he would </s>
<s> just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen </s>
<s> you could wish that </s>
<s> so you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights waiting for you for your new spectator pumps waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off because that is being an old maid too if you happen to drive a car it is changing the tire yourself in the night and in the mud and the rain hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help </s>
<s> it is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull </s>
<s> and most of all it is not having the only man you could love whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one </s>
<s> even when he is on the way to memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift and it is he inside of you </s>
<s> and in a way the promise works out true for whether he wants you or not you go with him in your heart </s>
<s> you feel him every mile further away </s>
<s> that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him that other guy </s>
<s> and you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to st louis where he got to be a big unhappy success </s>
<s> you wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you </s>
<s> she looked out at the corn field the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed fence bordering the grounds </s>
<s> the mayor envisioned factories there </s>
<s> homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments </s>
<s> the bands were impatient but they were the only ones </s>
<s> the others the ones in the stands were spellbound for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in new york city </s>
<s> it was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing </s>
<s> he was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the united states some day </s>
<s> so they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it not listening exactly but rather feeling </s>
<s> if a man was good if he was going to be governor you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever </s>
<s> you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too </s>
<s> it was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it </s>
<s> you laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your arm </s>
<s> he hit the theme about dying to defend your country and you were ready to do it right then without a second thought </s>
<s> back at the factory-to-you with the other old maids back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down </s>
<s> a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping </s>
<s> she could not count the times herman had rapped on the door just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might someday break away the pipe connections from the wall </s>
<s> the two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot </s>
<s> among us we three handled quite a few small commissions from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs </s>
<s> each of us had his own specialty besides </s>
<s> he also drew precise crisp spots which he sold to various literary and artistic journals the new yorker for instance or esquire </s>
<s> i did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver </s>
<s> the book could be the brothers karamazov but it would still have the same jacket illustration </s>
<s> i remember once i did a jacket for magpie press </s>
<s> they know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like little lord fauntleroy and only the villains had beards </s>
<s> in the end i did the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in the doorway only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy gave him a sword instead of a pistol and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie </s>
<s> mckenzie was as happy as a clam </s>
<s> as for donald he actually sold paintings </s>
<s> we all painted in our spare time and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it </s>
<s> not much </s>
<s> he sold perhaps three or four a year and usually all to joyce monmouth or her friends </s>
<s> he had style a real inner vision of his very own </s>
<s> there was the freshness of color the freedom of perception the lack of self-consciousness but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye </s>
<s> we used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted </s>
<s> he also had at times an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker </s>
<s> mrs monmouth thought of him as her discovery and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting </s>
<s> none of us did </s>
<s> we shared the expenses of the studio and we all lived within walking distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or another </s>
<s> i wanted to paint again </s>
<s> it was the kind of work i was doing the quality of the ambition it awoke in me that kept me from painting </s>
<s> askington was a kind of goal i set myself </s>
<s> i had admired him long before i talked to him </s>
<s> it looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want joy in his work standing in the profession a large and steady income </s>
<s> instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade </s>
<s> he was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in america </s>
<s> you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month </s>
<s> the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have velasquez in it painting the royalty of spain </s>
<s> i had a long talk with him </s>
<s> the fireplace had tiles made for mrs monmouth by picasso himself </s>
<s> like certain expensive restaurants just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself </s>
<s> in the course of our talk askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> he made a circle with his thumb and fingers </s>
<s> he threw his arms wide his face shining </s>
<s> the eye is all inward or outward </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> i was fascinated </s>
<s> just listening to him made me feel intelligent </s>
<s> i nodded </s>
<s> i had studied with burns ten years before during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on hudson street </s>
<s> burns and i had not loved each other </s>
<s> i said </s>
<s> he must be a million years old </s>
<s> askington laughed </s>
<s> still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful canvases of mountains and farms </s>
<s> and he is a great man </s>
<s> contact with him is stimulating </s>
<s> they lack stimulation </s>
<s> they sit alone in their rooms and try to paint and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life </s>
<s> in the middle ages in the renaissance right up to the early nineteenth century the painter was a giant in the world </s>
<s> he was an artisan a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did </s>
<s> he filled a real need showing society what it looked like turning it inside out portraying its wars and its leaders its ugliness and its beauties reflecting its profound religious impulses </s>
<s> but look at us today </s>
<s> we hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity </s>
<s> a bunch of amateur dervishes </s>
<s> he could certainly talk </s>
<s> it was mostly for the benefit of the mailman because hardly anybody else ever visited us </s>
<s> in a way askington was right </s>
<s> i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars </s>
<s> actually there was a lot of force in him which is why i kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week </s>
<s> she asked </s>
<s> i was silent </s>
<s> she looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud </s>
<s> walter was giving me checks for my pay the household bills </s>
<s> i was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace and then the lawyer would tear up all those things </s>
<s> i suppose i should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in </s>
<s> so i went about my business </s>
<s> i made a lemon sponge a light dessert roasted a chicken parboiled some frozen vegetables so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend </s>
<s> with this movie-to-be in london and new faces about her there she would soon be a more tranquil a wiser person all the better for her stay out here </s>
<s> i felt more cheerful as if i had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself </s>
<s> and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life </s>
<s> it was foggy that evening but the path to my house was so well grooved that i could feel my way accustomed as i was to the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river and sometimes last for days </s>
<s> in the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on </s>
<s> i did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the fog i assumed mrs salter had done the same before she left for town </s>
<s> prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove absent itself unsee </s>
<s> when i came back from church at noon mrs thaxter was turning into the salter driveway </s>
<s> dolly engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us </s>
<s> she screamed and both women ran up to the house and i followed </s>
<s> the search began in all the rooms running upstairs down opening closets talking exclaiming in rushes and gasps </s>
<s> and she </s>
<s> then the telephoning began </s>
<s> it was dolly and mrs thaxter who were calling via everybody </s>
<s> and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me </s>
<s> and after i brought them sandwiches and coffee i had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait </s>
<s> sitting in the kitchen i recalled every word mrs salter said that could have been a sign to me </s>
<s> i had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage just to check </s>
<s> the last night i had called but the line was always busy and it reassured me </s>
<s> i assumed it was one of those hour-long conversations with dolly or constance she comfortable in bed </s>
<s> but it seemed not from what they were saying </s>
<s> she was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff </s>
<s> i tried to believe that what must have happened was that restless disturbed by this telephone call or whatever she walked out in the night as she had a habit of doing </s>
<s> sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff </s>
<s> with all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock a misstep </s>
<s> when a fisherman brought her up in his arms still small as if she were a child asleep i began to shudder with a terrible excitement almost triumphant that i still cannot account for </s>
<s> everyone stared at me and drew back </s>
<s> and they have never changed </s>
<s> even now i am appalled at how little anyone knows of what they really are </s>
<s> it is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged me from the family i considered my very own but there it hangs a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other </s>
<s> at the time i was filled with self-pity at this separation but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that outcry </s>
<s> in my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her so if they told themselves that i could have prevented it i can understand that by now and love them still because everyone must justify have a scapegoat for what is not to be borne </s>
<s> it is not their avoidance that rankles </s>
<s> it is when i meet someone who was a close friend of the family and therefore of mine and they nod to me so coolly and walk away that it hurts </s>
<s> i could tell them but no one ever asked why i had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body </s>
<s> no i forget mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened </s>
<s> she haunted me </s>
<s> she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised mrs salter to return to the country </s>
<s> she frowned </s>
<s> i added </s>
<s> it was coarse almost insulting this harsh appraisal and she has never come to see me since </s>
<s> but suppose she had not taken mrs mathias advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns dispossessed of love hanging on to makeshifts and altogether and finally arid </s>
<s> if they say i could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of self-examination her search into herself and its conclusions </s>
<s> she was finally at rest in truth of her own proud free choice </s>
<s> at rest with my darling ellen the first mrs salter </s>
<s> mr salter came home </s>
<s> the funeral service was in the house the methodist minister how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words and the rain drumming incessantly in accompaniment seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed </s>
<s> i waited </s>
<s> the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the sheaf of white roses i had ordered </s>
<s> via was in the parking lot when i went outside </s>
<s> together we waited in her car until the hearse moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey </s>
<s> by the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet symbols of religious faiths </s>
<s> again i felt impelled to kneel and reached back and pulled via down </s>
<s> something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing </s>
<s> i think i was what you might call a convivial man and yet it was when i was alone in my studio doing my work that i really felt alive </s>
<s> pausing he waited for her to turn to ask a question </s>
<s> she showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home and it hurt him a little </s>
<s> she asked turning slowly </s>
<s> when she had wiped some of the lipstick from her mouth she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror </s>
<s> so he could have something of her for himself </s>
<s> she asked turning suddenly </s>
<s> this is my town </s>
<s> i sleep with you </s>
<s> the cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor and he got up and picked up one then another hoping she would notice what he was doing </s>
<s> at home he had been a clean orderly man and now he had to hide his annoyance </s>
<s> he wondered </s>
<s> he straightened up ready to vent his exasperation then grew afraid </s>
<s> if he dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her and without the respect he might lose his view of her too </s>
<s> she asked suddenly </s>
<s> he had put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in rome when he had encountered her on the street </s>
<s> you look like a tweedy englishman </s>
<s> changing his clothes he put on his dark-blue flannel suit and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good </s>
<s> but it was a hopeful sign he told himself </s>
<s> she no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in parioli </s>
<s> that day they loafed around just getting the feel of the city </s>
<s> they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower via veneto then they went to the farnese gardens </s>
<s> she had some amusing scandal about the farneses in the old days </s>
<s> then they took a taxi to trastevere </s>
<s> and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at santa maria he had to keep a straight face not letting on he had been there with alberto </s>
<s> he let her tell him all about the church </s>
<s> then they had dinner </s>
<s> all evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself </s>
<s> when they got home at midnight she was tired out </s>
<s> and in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing </s>
<s> he had never heard so many bells and as he lay there listening he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish steps </s>
<s> it was a good thing that she clung to her religion he thought </s>
<s> he wondered probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security </s>
<s> it would be good for her </s>
<s> it was too bad he had no feeling himself for church </s>
<s> she would have been better off if she had stuck to her bible </s>
<s> from the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know </s>
<s> then he thought of those old testament figures on the ceiling of the sistine chapel </s>
<s> just figures out of a tribal folklore </s>
<s> being a woman though she would take only what she needed from church </s>
<s> or a protestant or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists or a strict orthodox communist </s>
<s> it was the times he was sure </s>
<s> it was all too wearying </s>
<s> look somewhere else </s>
<s> just the same he thought pondering over it it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she got up and went to church </s>
<s> a half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the ferraros hearing them hurrying down the stairs would think they were going to a late mass </s>
<s> it seemed to him that if the ferraros felt sure of them could place them it would help him to feel more sure of himself with carla </s>
<s> she said </s>
<s> her words remained with him worrying him for hours </s>
<s> when they walked into the ferraro apartment the old lady bowing and smiling said softly </s>
<s> her little brown face wrinkled up her brown eyes gleamed and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things </s>
<s> and they sat down and began their little coffee party </s>
<s> the ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee </s>
<s> acting only as interpreter carla her hands folded on her lap was utterly impersonal </s>
<s> she would turn to them then turn to him then turn again </s>
<s> watching her he felt like a spectator at a tennis game with the ball being bounced back and forth </s>
<s> signora ferraro bobbing her head encouragingly asked sam about canada having a special interest </s>
<s> carla translated </s>
<s> the old woman had a nephew from north italy a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment and who had migrated to canada to work on the railway </s>
<s> for a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar </s>
<s> she wanted to know </s>
<s> regretfully sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars </s>
<s> just the same the old woman said she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country </s>
<s> and sam thanked her and hoped he might meet her nephew back home and asked her if she had any further news of the pope </s>
<s> a very great pope this one the old woman explained her black eyes sparkling </s>
<s> an intellectual </s>
<s> but very mystical too </s>
<s> it was said that he had had a vision </s>
<s> just as thousands that day in portugal had seen the sun dancing in the sky he had seen the same thing later in his own garden and she turned to agnese for confirmation </s>
<s> agnese had been sitting quietly listening with the serenity of the unaware </s>
<s> now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes </s>
<s> the holy father would die soon she said to carla so she could translate for sam although he had a brilliant doctor a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world </s>
<s> yes the pope could die and quickly be made a saint </s>
<s> no he was indeed a saint now </s>
<s> nodding approvingly and swelling with importance the old lady whispered confidentially </s>
<s> there was a certain discontent among the cardinals </s>
<s> the pope in the splendor of his great intellect had neglected them a little </s>
<s> there would be changes made and signor raymond should understand that when the pope died it was like the end of a regime in rome </s>
<s> jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent </s>
<s> surely she could see that these women were her italians too he thought </s>
<s> devout orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in brooklyn or malta or ireland </s>
<s> and carla watching in wonder turned to sam </s>
<s> with the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill caressing the flageolet with his lips making it whisper </s>
<s> he saw her emerge suddenly coming in her unhesitant fashion her back stiff her head erect facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach </s>
<s> in her dark scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination afraid of nothing not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding </s>
<s> seeing her come he caught his breath feeling his heart bounce in him and turned away afraid now </s>
<s> even he wanting her afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit feared the evil presences in her metabolism more </s>
<s> his breath caught and trembling he closed his eyes and stumbled off </s>
<s> going he saw as often before some queer hideous yellow face over his head shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs </s>
<s> he cried out to her his back turned </s>
<s> then he fled not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry </s>
<s> but she heard him go </s>
<s> yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly her neck tall as she looked in his direction and continued on her way toward the end of the camp </s>
<s> elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small curious clusters </s>
<s> early spring came from her bed from beside her half-drunk husband walitzee and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion the sound of hushed voices </s>
<s> standing there she saw shades of night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge silent almost imperious her body taut simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of walitzee waited perhaps denying the dread that moved in her </s>
<s> and it was not pile of clouds she meant </s>
<s> i will tell you to go not begging </s>
<s> and unsheathing the knife she used for curing hides she stepped away from the lodge holding the knife at her side </s>
<s> speaking in a low voice of loathing she went up to the girl who stood with the same upright scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife </s>
<s> i will not let your evil in </s>
<s> i will simply kill you first </s>
<s> the other women had come close now their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot their threats mingling rising nagging at each other each trying to make her indignation and anger felt </s>
<s> they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl </s>
<s> the sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs </s>
<s> they were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought </s>
<s> but she did not move taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly pile of clouds came howling among them swinging a great bullhide whip </s>
<s> he shouted </s>
<s> he made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming some tripping over themselves in their flight </s>
<s> and early spring seized the whip and said </s>
<s> but the old man turned on her jerking the whip from her hand </s>
<s> he spat </s>
<s> keep him back if you must tell me what to do </s>
<s> she retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where walitzee stirred mumbling sitting up in a half stupor to say </s>
<s> but she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from tuhulhulzote </s>
<s> lie back and go to sleep </s>
<s> but do not dream </s>
<s> he sank back sighing and was soon asleep again </s>
<s> outside the old man beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore went to her and twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms </s>
<s> and shoving her against a spruce her back to him he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged as dark and motionless as ever her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face </s>
<s> she stared at the pale tracings on the tree hearing her breath refracted from it her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark </s>
<s> the sounds of an animal in rage and despair </s>
<s> suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high quavering voice </s>
<s> move from the line or i will settle the whip on you </s>
<s> move </s>
<s> turning the girl saw dookiyoon standing between his narrow shoulders unbent his arms hanging long and resigned </s>
<s> then without knowing why she found herself running from them fleeing wildly through the trees dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry </s>
<s> for a while the young men waited outside the lodge of tuhulhulzote glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself </s>
<s> he shouted like a hoarse old mastiff his hair stiff and bristling </s>
<s> he ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies walking in circles in and out of his living place drinking stolen whisky in great gasping draughts until finally incoherent and sick he fell into his own oblivion </s>
<s> he amused the young men who had been silent long enough </s>
<s> but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics </s>
<s> now they moved rubbing their flesh alive again disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them </s>
<s> they came out and held their games and races </s>
<s> it was they who held the future in their hands </s>
<s> they went into the sun together and paraded grandly in their war clothes painting their faces with the sacred attis dug far off in the cave of skeletons </s>
<s> they danced the paxam wildly at night the war dance and dipped their arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers firing their few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal </s>
<s> walitzee was among them and sarpsis and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing </s>
<s> and a very young one swan necklace tried to emulate them and followed timidly </s>
<s> yellow wolf was there nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked </s>
<s> he would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction because something had boiled over in his fermenting juices </s>
<s> all the young men alokut among them challenged them in matched racing </s>
<s> they raced and maneuvered for war swinging their horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry </s>
<s> at times they would ride frenziedly through the camp letting the women see their courage how handsome they were in their regalia </s>
<s> then again they would stand in circles making other preparations </s>
<s> they combed their hair and streaked it at the part and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood rigid like the tails of sage hens making love </s>
<s> walitzee whitened his leggings with clay knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees </s>
<s> he saw himself in a superior reflection and he was as a speeding arrow from the taut bow hurtling with a mad grace his maleness shining and scented with meadow rue </s>
<s> and the suspicious envenomed eyes of pile of clouds </s>
<s> and those of early spring haunted and now full of hurt and envy </s>
<s> he felt so much like laughing </s>
<s> even like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs </s>
<s> he and sarpsis planned a great parade with the young men </s>
<s> they would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance </s>
<s> they would ride with streaming amulets their colors ripening in the sun shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death </s>
<s> they mounted their horses and rode off into the hills </s>
<s> the </s>
<s> young chief stared at the wall of his lodge listening </s>
<s> the sound rose on the other side of the hills vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad disheveled hoofs of the appaloosas horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell </s>
<s> he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge </s>
<s> standing then with the others peering into the sun he saw the bright multicolored legion their hair flying like dark banners only the thunder the roll of drums the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying them </s>
<s> they leaned into the wind and seemed like one thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted ejaculated their grotesque cry of war </s>
<s> she was moving through a screen of hemlocks in among the white birch and maples </s>
<s> the sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears </s>
<s> she stood once more listening </s>
<s> she had never been here at this hour </s>
<s> she felt as if some dark totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm </s>
<s> but she found the path she always used the stubs of branches she had broken those she had pushed aside </s>
<s> and she walked easily now and more slowly until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her </s>
<s> she smiled and expertly let herself downward holding this known root or that her sneakers sliding in the leaves </s>
<s> she jumped out onto the flat expanse of rock and seating herself shook her short-cut brown hair and tilted her chin far upward </s>
<s> the reedy music of the frogs had faded but presently it began again growing in volume until it was vibrant </s>
<s> julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees </s>
<s> she had accomplished a miracle </s>
<s> this was her place </s>
<s> they were becoming confused </s>
<s> perhaps it was because it was so late and because she had no business to be here now </s>
<s> she was thinking of paul a few weeks ago in the easter holidays with her at one of those awful friday evening dancing class parties her mother had made her attend </s>
<s> and then off he went so casually to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a lower-cut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him </s>
<s> i wish he was with me now she thought and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment </s>
<s> oh god </s>
<s> i wish i were older or younger julia bentley thought </s>
<s> i wish so much someone loved me </s>
<s> she had vanished </s>
<s> he must have slept again </s>
<s> he was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him </s>
<s> it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch </s>
<s> but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday morning </s>
<s> this room was like a prison </s>
<s> he would not be indebted to sam </s>
<s> below him as if at the end of some remote tunnel he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner </s>
<s> his fingers fumbled across the bandages </s>
<s> they had left both of his eyes uncovered </s>
<s> he was walking across to the bathroom </s>
<s> he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands </s>
<s> a fearful pain had come from his head as if the water were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them </s>
<s> he recognized his jacket and trousers </s>
<s> the fabric was dark </s>
<s> and there were his shoes thank god but his shirt was one terrible mess </s>
<s> he shivered and then tore away the blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf </s>
<s> sam would be amazed to find him gone </s>
<s> millie would have to understand </s>
<s> she must have put his clothes in the closet </s>
<s> he found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness </s>
<s> he was on the verge of tears </s>
<s> perhaps george rawlings would be better off dead </s>
<s> he peered at his wristwatch </s>
<s> strange it was still running </s>
<s> a quarter to seven </s>
<s> too early for a vacuum cleaner but probably sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs </s>
<s> he was kneeling to tie his shoelaces </s>
<s> his fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy </s>
<s> he rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door </s>
<s> he barely knew himself </s>
<s> this was some freak two strands of adhesive tape across his nose like ugly roots from the mass of gauze suddenly moist over his cheekbones </s>
<s> the surface however was perfectly white </s>
<s> he was drinking another glass of water </s>
<s> he was supposed to be in court this afternoon at city hall </s>
<s> he entered the hallway </s>
<s> he was actually walking down the stairs </s>
<s> a plane up in the sky above the clouds and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away </s>
<s> the voice issued from the cavern of the hall below </s>
<s> george did not reply </s>
<s> for a moment he felt like a thief discovered </s>
<s> then julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room </s>
<s> she stood gazing at him </s>
<s> he was trying to smile at her </s>
<s> she was wearing some sort of gray blazer </s>
<s> she seemed overly tall her brow knitted in concern </s>
<s> she asked him </s>
<s> her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight </s>
<s> she asked in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated considerate and yet perhaps partly scornful </s>
<s> he tried to see her face more clearly </s>
<s> he leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids </s>
<s> he raised them </s>
<s> julia moved past </s>
<s> she had disappeared </s>
<s> he could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages </s>
<s> he could hear the footsteps overhead </s>
<s> he saw the suitcase which julia was holding </s>
<s> he stood up </s>
<s> she went ahead of him </s>
<s> outside the lincoln was parked </s>
<s> he could hardly believe he was getting in </s>
<s> pietro was gazing at him in an insolent disdainful fashion </s>
<s> yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed </s>
<s> he could not stop to analyze </s>
<s> he had never felt particularly close to her </s>
<s> carrie seemed more affectionate but obviously julia had respected his request </s>
<s> he took her hand </s>
<s> she said nothing until pietro had slackened their pace </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> his voice seemed thick and purposeless </s>
<s> he relinquished her hand </s>
<s> he could see the stone building where he lived </s>
<s> just a few more steps </s>
<s> abruptly he reached into his pocket </s>
<s> yes there was the key </s>
<s> she asked him </s>
<s> for a moment he smiled </s>
<s> you also </s>
<s> it was an automatic phrase </s>
<s> as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it </s>
<s> he should have discovered a more tender farewell </s>
<s> will you look at george rawlings </s>
<s> someone laughed </s>
<s> george walked steadily ahead into his entry </s>
<s> his bandages seemed on fire </s>
<s> he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it </s>
<s> in the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp </s>
<s> just one or two swallows he told himself enough to lessen some of the pain </s>
<s> he was telephoning </s>
<s> no really right as rain </s>
<s> tell sam not to worry about the car </s>
<s> that upsets me more than anything </s>
<s> there was one more call to make </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> look sweetheart some fool was </s>
<s> happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night </s>
<s> i might struggle in for a jury </s>
<s> but i thought maybe tony elliott could pinch-hit for me </s>
<s> a smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape </s>
<s> he had put down the receiver </s>
<s> a strange relationship between joan fulbright and himself </s>
<s> she lived alone in the older part of the city in one of those renovated houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed </s>
<s> she had two tiny rooms on the second floor </s>
<s> she was a clever girl a most efficient secretary </s>
<s> she let him come and go as he pleased or as it pleased her </s>
<s> in the office you might have thought them only casual friends </s>
<s> she knew that </s>
<s> lucy listened </s>
<s> obviously susan was not </s>
<s> upstairs busy feet showering like raindrops pattered around her room </s>
<s> susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days but even at seven she was a prudent soul </s>
<s> she always packed for a lifetime just in case </s>
<s> as he looked at her it registered anxiety </s>
<s> lucy did not believe him </s>
<s> myra appreciated nothing </s>
<s> leaving cathy with them myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly brief visit </s>
<s> lucy had an idea that myra loved it </s>
<s> and not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down </s>
<s> it seemed to lucy that all their married life she and jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life </s>
<s> remembering that succession of disasters she now considered cathy an ominous child-cloud on her horizon </s>
<s> it was not that she disliked cathy </s>
<s> the youngster drew her troubled her depths </s>
<s> whenever lucy saw her she tried without noise or fuss to give her the warmth she had never had from myra </s>
<s> myra loved big cities </s>
<s> lucy knew her too well to find it impossible </s>
<s> jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-cathy </s>
<s> susan </s>
<s> a startled piping sound returned </s>
<s> their arms around each other they had been talking of the present and the future </s>
<s> their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm as steeped in light as the air around them </s>
<s> then from within the still sleeping house the telephone had rung </s>
<s> myra with her news was on the other end of the line </s>
<s> jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her </s>
<s> his dark brows which had been lowered in anger smoothed </s>
<s> they were husband and wife and myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage </s>
<s> the only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless selfish sister of his </s>
<s> lucy was sick of it </s>
<s> susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse </s>
<s> her arms were straining with a burden of dolls </s>
<s> jim said </s>
<s> his voice had sharp edges as though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment </s>
<s> susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief </s>
<s> to her each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart </s>
<s> she gave jim a quick shape-up look of warning </s>
<s> there ought to be a limit to sharing too </s>
<s> the last one had been a lilliputian war </s>
<s> she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had </s>
<s> she had let jim go with a chilly good-by a chillier kiss </s>
<s> she was sorry and angry at herself because never in their life together had she done that </s>
<s> she turned and began to walk toward the house </s>
<s> at the feeding station the raffish group of cowbirds again bobbed and gobbled over the ground but now gorgeous among them was a beautiful red cardinal radiant in its feathered vestments </s>
<s> the handsome bird was solitary </s>
<s> its mate must be at home silently guarding their nest </s>
<s> she had better stay there lucy thought </s>
<s> the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels </s>
<s> she said to herself abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds </s>
<s> she had a day of things to do </s>
<s> among them she had to prepare the guest room </s>
<s> she wondered with a baffled feeling of helplessness </s>
<s> for a moment her mind returned again to the strange flying world of birds and she said to herself </s>
<s> in the sunshine of late afternoon lucy stood looking at the ready guest room </s>
<s> many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her </s>
<s> out in the hall the upstairs phone shrilled and the small ghost vanished </s>
<s> myra dropped cathy this morning and jim picked cathy up and left susan a few hours ago </s>
<s> susan was an active character </s>
<s> for mother to be able to call susan must be napping now surrounded by her multitude of dolls </s>
<s> lucy drew out the chair and sat down </s>
<s> she relaxed a little and some of the tension went out of her </s>
<s> you could think yourself as grown up as methuselah yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic </s>
<s> puzzled lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper </s>
<s> her mother was forthright </s>
<s> she was not usually given to mysterious silences </s>
<s> she hesitated as though hunting over words and ways of putting them </s>
<s> shocked speechless lucy sat there </s>
<s> then she jumped to her feet the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake </s>
<s> it was only too true </s>
<s> myra had no intention whatever of sending for cathy in two weeks </s>
<s> for a moment anger darkened the hallway about her and when she found her voice anger thickened it </s>
<s> she said </s>
<s> her hand tightened on the receiver </s>
<s> cowbird myra </s>
<s> cathy is tired lucy thought watching them come slowly up the path </s>
<s> she trudged along slowly both hands clutching a tired teddy bear </s>
<s> unlike susan she was traveling light </s>
<s> the worn teddy bear a tiny suitcase that jim carried and the clothes she wore were all she had </s>
<s> lucy glancing at the miniature case knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays </s>
<s> they would have to buy things for her </s>
<s> she opened the door </s>
<s> unimpressed the dog plopped on the sand </s>
<s> now they were in friendly territory </s>
<s> nobody around </s>
<s> his rock was to the right of a v-shaped inlet a big brown lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers </s>
<s> his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here </s>
<s> here he was enclosed and safe </s>
<s> here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe </s>
<s> he was canute controlling the waves </s>
<s> he was six feet one like his father with big hands and a hairy chest a man the weak and persecuted would turn to </s>
<s> fearless </s>
<s> it happened two weeks ago the night before his father left on a business trip to south america </s>
<s> every piece of the nightmare was clear in place </s>
<s> son </s>
<s> look i can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck </s>
<s> dr fortman says swimming would help your leg </s>
<s> big dumb nut </s>
<s> in the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out </s>
<s> victoria was fourteen months younger than quint a head taller and could lick any boy or girl on the beach </s>
<s> quint said now to the clouds </s>
<s> strength began to zip up and down his chest </s>
<s> he felt strong as a giant </s>
<s> he unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg </s>
<s> he wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks </s>
<s> he stood on the rock a skinny dignified boy surrounded by the ocean </s>
<s> the wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there bleeding wedged between the rocks and the waves </s>
<s> shivering he put on his clothes </s>
<s> and shivering with shame he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water </s>
<s> she was holding on to his rock with one hand </s>
<s> she smelled of peppermints </s>
<s> he snapped </s>
<s> she was sore as a boil </s>
<s> her cough sounded like cloth ripping </s>
<s> she was horrified </s>
<s> she seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace </s>
<s> she spouted a mouthful of water into the air </s>
<s> maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail </s>
<s> quint glared </s>
<s> he always did when people asked </s>
<s> he would have told her but victoria was yodeling </s>
<s> even though this is my rock you can use it sometimes </s>
<s> that was how they started being friends </s>
<s> they met next morning and all the mornings thereafter </s>
<s> it made her blister </s>
<s> her name was sabella and the strip of seaweed around her neck was an emerald necklace the king gave her as a token of his undying love </s>
<s> naturally curly hair runs in my family </s>
<s> japan she said smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks </s>
<s> then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup </s>
<s> pugh </s>
<s> camels in tripoli had harelips </s>
<s> near galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night </s>
<s> they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them </s>
<s> quint smothered a yawn </s>
<s> artfully as the days went by he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the navy cross in the korean war </s>
<s> that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it </s>
<s> she skipped a piece of water at him and laughed a funny hoarse laugh he liked to hear </s>
<s> nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as sabella </s>
<s> he described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries cooling on the porch </s>
<s> but it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head </s>
<s> sometimes they argued </s>
<s> she said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward </s>
<s> his encylopedia agreed with sabella </s>
<s> next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the v-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around </s>
<s> boy could she catch </s>
<s> like willie mays in the outfield </s>
<s> her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough </s>
<s> he daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around </s>
<s> but victoria began yodeling just then and he went home carrying sabella in the back of his head not thinking about her just knowing she was there smiling smelling of peppermints </s>
<s> wednesday morning it happened </s>
<s> they were eating breakfast </s>
<s> the baby can have an early nap </s>
<s> the cave in his stomach hurt </s>
<s> he had to go into the water </s>
<s> it had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung </s>
<s> all of it together meant drowning </s>
<s> linda looked remote yet lovely in black and everyone held his or her breath </s>
<s> not that linda was heartless not that she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than john cooper would </s>
<s> everybody knew that john cooper had married edythe on the rebound </s>
<s> for it had been john and linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs </s>
<s> john had claimed her from the stag line a young man a year out of dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes </s>
<s> you saw them always together those years </s>
<s> you talked about john-and-linda as an entity </s>
<s> john-and-linda were at longue vue last night </s>
<s> john-and-linda drove to conneaut in three and a half hours </s>
<s> then there was a spat over something as there had been lovers spats before </s>
<s> it got worse instead of better </s>
<s> he was a bright and handsome young man from new york who worked for the same steel company as john did </s>
<s> some people said linda had just announced the engagement to jolt john into some action but when john came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe his bride it could no longer be john-and-linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers </s>
<s> it was simply poor john </s>
<s> there was nothing specifically wrong with edythe but there was absolutely nothing right about her either </s>
<s> bobbie and linda looked magnificent at their wedding </s>
<s> john was at the church with edythe </s>
<s> edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example </s>
<s> her hair never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct length </s>
<s> mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity </s>
<s> there were less-dramatic reasons too </s>
<s> john sold the big old place in sewickley and bought a smaller house in fox chapel </s>
<s> he was not reduced to poverty but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day </s>
<s> john was good at his job </s>
<s> she never could fit into a crowd which had known which still knew and admired linda </s>
<s> john did find the missing checks and money afterward and the drive was actually oversubscribed which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries </s>
<s> being an intelligent man john must have guessed what everyone thought about edythe but he never let on by so much as a brave smile </s>
<s> poor john was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one </s>
<s> he was an attentive and generous husband overgenerous a lot of people felt because they knew that money must be a problem to him </s>
<s> but he got ahead in business on leave from his job to an important washington assignment during the war </s>
<s> after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company </s>
<s> the coopers saw bobbie and linda socially but no more than was necessary </s>
<s> he and linda settled down to being social leaders and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year </s>
<s> and then came the hairpin turn the smashed jaguar and linda mourning alone and lovely </s>
<s> everyone held his or her breath </s>
<s> what she felt was a bone-deep loss with a sense of waste to it not so much sorrow for handsome ambitious bobbie but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death </s>
<s> she knew what people were thinking </s>
<s> it was what she had been thinking herself </s>
<s> it was up to her to save poor john dear john to undo the wrong she had done but she trembled at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream </s>
<s> there was no one who would blame her or john </s>
<s> she could be sure of that </s>
<s> it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her to send her back to cleveland or anywhere </s>
<s> and linda felt capable of capturing the affection of the children anxious even since she and bobbie had had none of their own </s>
<s> it would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of </s>
<s> linda would have to wait she knew </s>
<s> years of watching while poor john struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead </s>
<s> of course he had done wonders </s>
<s> bobbie had been head of the alloy division while john was just another good salesman in the regular branch </s>
<s> so when old mr lovejoy the company president talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular steels had gone with carnegie-illinois it looked like the perfect chance for bobbie </s>
<s> for linda knew how to help her husband not just the stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners for reuben lovejoy </s>
<s> she was almost sick when bobbie came home with the news that poor john had won the job </s>
<s> she asked bobbie </s>
<s> bobbie said something about damned pittsburghers sticking together and linda got angry at him </s>
<s> they had their first real fight and bobbie went off to get drunk </s>
<s> linda dragooned her uncle donald murkland into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened </s>
<s> with that wife of his i think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance </s>
<s> bobbie with linda behind him will have plenty of other opportunities </s>
<s> most of the directors nodded </s>
<s> uncle donald murkland found himself nodding agreement too </s>
<s> when he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future </s>
<s> she called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night </s>
<s> i could get along without that three dollars </s>
<s> it was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang </s>
<s> i stumbled through the hall wondering who would be calling at this hour </s>
<s> i answered to find nadine at the other end </s>
<s> her voice came shrill </s>
<s> i was all set for what came next </s>
<s> please janice </s>
<s> so sure that money could do anything </s>
<s> not for the dollar or so nadine would give me </s>
<s> i dressed in the kitchen then left a note on the table telling him what had happened </s>
<s> her face was flushed from sleep </s>
<s> and nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable </s>
<s> the phone started ringing </s>
<s> i crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone </s>
<s> the receiver clicked in my ear </s>
<s> so i told her mrs roberts would pay her in the morning and she scooted off to her own apartment </s>
<s> after i looked in at francie i went into the living room and waited </s>
<s> i must have dozed off because i came to with a start at the sound of voices </s>
<s> i had always thought she was so beautiful </s>
<s> but now she looked ugly </s>
<s> her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out and if looks could kill wally would have been dead </s>
<s> he lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it and was instantly asleep </s>
<s> nadine strode over to him and her pointed nails raked across his face </s>
<s> i grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right and she was crazy </s>
<s> her eyes were wild </s>
<s> and the other people there were listening </s>
<s> i was plenty scared </s>
<s> in the state she was in she could actually kill him </s>
<s> i clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth </s>
<s> she collapsed against me as if everything inside her snapped </s>
<s> i got her into bed and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out </s>
<s> i left her a limp bundle of self-pity shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her </s>
<s> wally was snoring on the davenport </s>
<s> i had done all i could </s>
<s> i had done all i was going to do </s>
<s> whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine </s>
<s> i drove home found chris still asleep </s>
<s> i kept on being thankful </s>
<s> in the afternoon nadine and wally came over with francie </s>
<s> wally sat in our big chair his hands between his knees looking ready to cry </s>
<s> seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side </s>
<s> mr thom had gotten wally on the phone and fired him </s>
<s> i tried to quiet nadine because the children were there </s>
<s> but she was beyond caring what she said </s>
<s> little by little during the week chris and i discovered the crazy unbelievable way nadine and wally had lived </s>
<s> on top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent and the day wally received written notice that he was fired they were evicted </s>
<s> worst of all wally had no training for any kind of work </s>
<s> he had fallen into a soft job and now the job was gone and he was stranded </s>
<s> chris fretted </s>
<s> i said i wished we were too </s>
<s> but chris brightened up like a candle </s>
<s> there is one big way we can help them </s>
<s> something i had simply never thought of </s>
<s> i just stared at him </s>
<s> then i felt uncomfortable too </s>
<s> but in the end we did </s>
<s> it just seemed as if there was nothing else to do </s>
<s> then wally got sick </s>
<s> to my way of thinking he was scared sick </s>
<s> his luck had failed him and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world </s>
<s> chris made trip after trip in our old car moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries nadine had bought on special </s>
<s> while i worked nadine sat and cried </s>
<s> it was a mess all right </s>
<s> i figured i could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks </s>
<s> but the two weeks dragged into three and they were still with us </s>
<s> he set out every morning looking for work and come home around noon full of alibis and excuses </s>
<s> wendell thom had black-balled him </s>
<s> nobody would even take his application </s>
<s> but this was only the middle of july </s>
<s> i mentioned it to chris one stifling hot night when i had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air </s>
<s> but i swear to you from the moment i opened my eyes i knew it was going to be a bad day </s>
<s> part of it was the weather so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital </s>
<s> it was just going to be one of those days </s>
<s> and for the thousandth time i answered myself </s>
<s> i had a lot to be thankful for </s>
<s> i was lucky in lots of ways no doubt about it </s>
<s> especially in the way gladdy had turned out </s>
<s> she is a closed book a picture i keep on my bureau but never look at </s>
<s> i had a feeling that young pete michelson the most promising intern at fairview had something to do with it too </s>
<s> but once i was alone again driving to the hospital the heaviness returned </s>
<s> the boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when i got to fairview </s>
<s> two interns and dick ishii the other resident </s>
<s> the ward was a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics </s>
<s> it was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward </s>
<s> the moment i walked in the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed </s>
<s> i looked at the chart for reassurance </s>
<s> yes rose bancroft diagnosis acute alcoholism </s>
<s> she looked about sixty though i recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four </s>
<s> an ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry </s>
<s> no no it was an unfortunate resemblance that was all it was and i turned to dick forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind </s>
<s> in a low voice dick filled us in </s>
<s> it was the old story </s>
<s> i tell you it took every ounce of control i had to be able to speak </s>
<s> her voice was flat and dull </s>
<s> it was then that i saw what the drawn-back covers revealed </s>
<s> there were bloodspots on the sheet </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> she shook her head </s>
<s> once again there was a negative shake </s>
<s> i told miss groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table </s>
<s> pete stood by with a slide and took the smear sent it down to the lab with a request for the test </s>
<s> that done i told miss groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind </s>
<s> i was busy the rest of the day </s>
<s> late in the afternoon i was up on seven again </s>
<s> one of my private patients was being admitted and i went in to see her settled </s>
<s> on my way to the elevator i ran into pete </s>
<s> class three they said </s>
<s> but that was ridiculous of course </s>
<s> i grimaced in distaste </s>
<s> her eyes opened as soon as she heard me though and once again i felt an inward shiver </s>
<s> there was something almost insulting in her tone but i disregarded it </s>
<s> it was flat definite </s>
<s> i looked at her in amazement </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> she smiled a smile without humor </s>
<s> she went on disregarding my protests </s>
<s> let your pupils learn on someone else doctor </s>
<s> i stared at her almost speechless </s>
<s> her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person i thought she was </s>
<s> even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone </s>
<s> a long long way down </s>
<s> i gaped at her </s>
<s> but there was that something some echo in the way she spoke </s>
<s> she was watching me intently a funny little half-smile on her lips </s>
<s> i knew then knew with a heart-stopping shock </s>
<s> she shrugged </s>
<s> the way she spoke her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout made me shudder </s>
<s> let me outta here </s>
<s> i looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me </s>
<s> and gladdy would be safe </s>
<s> i was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea </s>
<s> she made me welcome </s>
<s> yielding-mediterranian-woman- she soothed me and drew me deeper into her </s>
<s> the reasons for this dive seemed foolish now </s>
<s> only the dive itself had any meaning </s>
<s> the metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water </s>
<s> perhaps if i took off the aqua-lung i could swim better love my woman better </s>
<s> i chuckled aloud and the mouthpiece fell out </s>
<s> while a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down a clear part sorted over recent events among them my only positive act in a long time </s>
<s> it was when i packed up what duds i had and went to paris </s>
<s> it was no vacation just me getting out after a bellyfull </s>
<s> wild kicks never are but i hoped to dig up a better frame of mind </s>
<s> once before i had been to paris long before i married valery </s>
<s> that first time was good and it stuck with me </s>
<s> i was twenty-one back then in the army and fog put our plane down at orly instead of rhine-main </s>
<s> it was a saturday evening in april with a mist-like rain and i was a little high on the good taste of life </s>
<s> i had a pocketful of money which was unusual when i was in the army and the plane would be grounded all night </s>
<s> in less than an hour i had gotten a hotel showered shaved and was out on the champs elysees in a fresh uniform </s>
<s> i felt like a hun in rome </s>
<s> all the women were beautiful and the men were equal to them </s>
<s> everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes </s>
<s> i never got there </s>
<s> i met claire which was better </s>
<s> she was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could and washing it down with red wine </s>
<s> i stared </s>
<s> she was blonde and young and nice and round in a tight white dress </s>
<s> when she had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill she came directly to my table and said </s>
<s> i feel another of terrible urgency </s>
<s> and so off we went to her apartment </s>
<s> she was a nymphomaniac of course the poor girl </s>
<s> toward the break of day i waxed philosophical and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese </s>
<s> i got there on a saturday evening </s>
<s> i made the mistake of going to the jour et nuit </s>
<s> i sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up </s>
<s> i went to my hotel and slept </s>
<s> so i drank more cognac </s>
<s> all that day and monday i drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space </s>
<s> i read the tropic of capricorn and the tropic of cancer </s>
<s> elemental but sex </s>
<s> i was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when i dozed off </s>
<s> i felt better tuesday evening when i woke up </s>
<s> my head was clear my thinking sober and i was reconciled to this paris idea as a flop on top of all my others </s>
<s> a good binge has that kind of therapeutic value </s>
<s> sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing </s>
<s> i went out into it </s>
<s> i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park and i sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky </s>
<s> there was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night </s>
<s> i was just miserable </s>
<s> pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick </s>
<s> she saw me and sat down beside me three feet away </s>
<s> suddenly i understood why she had the umbrella </s>
<s> it gave her poise and posture </s>
<s> without it she would have been drab and limp </s>
<s> it gave her propriety </s>
<s> it gave her the right to sit down beside me back straight one hand out on the handle </s>
<s> i knew all about her </s>
<s> she was another human being and happened to be a hustler </s>
<s> she asked gently </s>
<s> she must have seen the ring on my left hand </s>
<s> this took me so funny i had to look at her </s>
<s> i even snorted a chuckle </s>
<s> she smiled at me but it was an awfully sad smile </s>
<s> she was even more miserable than me </s>
<s> her eyes were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them </s>
<s> she asked </s>
<s> i could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes and i wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit </s>
<s> anyway i pulled a bottle of remy martin out of my topcoat drew the cork and passed it to her </s>
<s> i could see she was shocked </s>
<s> she tilted up and drank and then i drank </s>
<s> no child this tart she must have been thirty-five or even forty </s>
<s> somehow she was attractive </s>
<s> not good looking but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive </s>
<s> i liked her and all at once i was glad she was there </s>
<s> we seemed to be drowsing sadly soberly in the cold cold air while the snow fell </s>
<s> i sensed no stranger in her </s>
<s> we undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance i had once known with valery </s>
<s> i decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age </s>
<s> she had a funny little scar on her stomach on the left side </s>
<s> i think we were very tired for we awoke at the same moment deeply rested surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows which were wet where the rime had melted </s>
<s> my head was clear </s>
<s> i was hungry as a wolf and my body felt lean and vital </s>
<s> she looked good with her short tousled hair and no make-up </s>
<s> maybe closer to thirty i thought </s>
<s> she exclaimed smiling </s>
<s> with a laugh she beat me to the bathroom </s>
<s> i called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her </s>
<s> she came out pink from a hot bath and i gave her my robe </s>
<s> i had brushed my teeth showered shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast </s>
<s> i gave it to the woman </s>
<s> she asked innocently </s>
<s> i said with round eyes </s>
<s> i wondered if i ought to go use the new one myself </s>
<s> but i smelled the coffee and thinking what the hell live dangerously i decided i would scald my worries away </s>
<s> we sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham hot hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread </s>
<s> as we ate we talked </s>
<s> her name was suzanne and mine stephen </s>
<s> we sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee </s>
<s> i grunted sipping </s>
<s> i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror </s>
<s> i said with enthusiasm at the idea </s>
<s> i put aside my empty cup </s>
<s> she smiled all the way to her wise sad eyes and drained her own </s>
<s> we were not rushed </s>
<s> i asked touching the scar on her stomach </s>
<s> it was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle </s>
<s> the cynicism was back in her eyes a bitter wisdom and i wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all </s>
<s> she understood sex anyway and played at it well </s>
<s> we went to the louvre for a few hours then by metro to a cabaret in montmartre </s>
<s> it was a nice place not filled with smoke </s>
<s> we had champagne and steamed mussels </s>
<s> the sommelier brought the wine first a magnum instead of the bottle i had ordered </s>
<s> he must have thought i was a tourist </s>
<s> two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield she put them in her bag </s>
<s> she would not stop to read them in american express as many were doing sitting on benches or leaning against the walls but pushed her way out into the street </s>
<s> this was her first day in rome and it was june </s>
<s> an enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead </s>
<s> pictures in old latin books returned to her the appian way today the colosseum the arch of constantine </s>
<s> she would see them looking just as they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight </s>
<s> england france germany switzerland and italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight to see all these places with her own eyes </s>
<s> so here it was here was italy anyway and terribly noisy </s>
<s> in the street the traffic was really frightening </s>
<s> cars taxis buses and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain </s>
<s> glad to be alone theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left </s>
<s> the spanish steps </s>
<s> she had heard about it the night before at her hotel </s>
<s> it was not yet complete workmen were unloading the potted plants from a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above </s>
<s> the azaleas were as large as shrubs and their myriad blooms many still tight in the bud ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink along with many white ones too </s>
<s> marvelous thought theresa climbing in her portly well-bred way for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything </s>
<s> in rome all over europe she intended to move very slowly indeed </s>
<s> halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down </s>
<s> other people were doing it too sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above watching the azaleas mass or just enjoying the sun </s>
<s> theresa sat with her letters in her lap breathing mediterranean air </s>
<s> the sun warmed her as it seemed to be warming everything perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches </s>
<s> she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette </s>
<s> content excited </s>
<s> strange but she was </s>
<s> presently she picked up the first of the letters </s>
<s> a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay </s>
<s> of course one of them would have to go and do this </s>
<s> she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her </s>
<s> cousin emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield rome italy on the envelope had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka alabama and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor </s>
<s> no return address whatsoever </s>
<s> across the envelope and now theresa had it all as easily as if she had been the president of the republic or the pope </s>
<s> inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness death and burial of cousin alexander carraway </s>
<s> two days before he was taken sick cousin elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas and cousin elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl paper knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died </s>
<s> she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope and turned with relief to one from her brother george </s>
<s> he was full of heavy family reminiscence </s>
<s> all the fine old stock was dying out look at the world today </s>
<s> a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived had to be known at first hand </s>
<s> poor george </s>
<s> the only boy the family darling </s>
<s> together with her mother both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong </s>
<s> theresa had seen him through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife anne had not seemed to understand poor george </s>
<s> there they all did their uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot </s>
<s> he had hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped in his bathrobe on a footstool </s>
<s> they all surrounded him the family circle theresa and george as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens and cousin emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan </s>
<s> she kept repeating </s>
<s> he was younger than theresa she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused </s>
<s> now here they both were still the same george full of round-eyed woe and cousin emma in despair </s>
<s> theresa shifted to a new page </s>
<s> but there is more in this than meets the eye </s>
<s> a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in </s>
<s> the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off </s>
<s> i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best </s>
<s> she got up standing uncertainly for a moment then moving aside to let go past her talking a group of young men </s>
<s> they wore shoes with pointed toes odd to american eyes and narrow trousers and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick </s>
<s> yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome and felt themselves to be so </s>
<s> just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos parker fountain pens rosaries papal portraits </s>
<s> she said </s>
<s> the man did not wish to leave </s>
<s> he knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them </s>
<s> carrozza rides in the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialized </s>
<s> theresa turned away to escape and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two </s>
<s> there she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of banister while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed american lady carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag ascending the steps alone </s>
<s> was he ever successful theresa wondered </s>
<s> the lady with the alligator bag registered interest doubt then indignation </s>
<s> at last alarm </s>
<s> finally she scurried away up the steps </s>
<s> the trouble is theresa thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist </s>
<s> they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow </s>
<s> it would have been exactly the same to them if i had read through all twenty-six volumes of elsie dinsmore </s>
<s> she arranged the letters carefully one on top of the other </s>
<s> then with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself she tore them in two </s>
<s> she became aware that two italian workmen carrying a large azalea pot were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display </s>
<s> she indicated a spot a little distance away </s>
<s> they even talked about lucille down at the young christians league where i spent a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission </s>
<s> i never heard my folks talk about her though </s>
<s> they were good-living religious people and i can truthfully say i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody </s>
<s> my folks and my faith protected me from things like that </s>
<s> and so i was really upset the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing mrs warren </s>
<s> i asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck </s>
<s> i asked him if it was true </s>
<s> he gave me a straight honest answer </s>
<s> i guess it was at that moment that i realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren </s>
<s> johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line </s>
<s> it was a vivid sharp february morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing some stuff dad had ordered </s>
<s> his smile was quick and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp </s>
<s> the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me too </s>
<s> i could hardly believe such good luck was mine </s>
<s> and now lucille warren had gotten a look at him </s>
<s> i guess she was between affairs or something but anyway she had set her sights on johnnie my johnnie </s>
<s> neither was his wife </s>
<s> he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy </s>
<s> johnnie loved me and wanted me </s>
<s> but the only love i was giving him was the pure kind </s>
<s> it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time </s>
<s> but by the time the first crackling of spring came around we both knew we were hopelessly in love </s>
<s> yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck a little </s>
<s> somebody with no vices </s>
<s> he examined his nails carefully </s>
<s> please </s>
<s> he shrugged noncommittally </s>
<s> and now he was seeing her </s>
<s> i huddled miserably beside him in the truck </s>
<s> johnnie and i had been innocent in our love and that was the way i wanted to keep it </s>
<s> i had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman </s>
<s> i had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil </s>
<s> my very first time </s>
<s> i was desperate to hold him to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed and to keep him from the clutches of lucille warren </s>
<s> and though at the time i blushed to admit it even to myself there was in me a growing desire a sexual awareness that johnnie had set in motion an awareness that no other man had ever triggered </s>
<s> i wanted him with a terrifying fierceness </s>
<s> astonishingly enough it was my own voice i heard there in the darkness begging this man to make love to me </s>
<s> outside in the summertime fields behind the motel a thousand crickets serenaded us </s>
<s> and i snuggled closer to the man i loved </s>
<s> it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced </s>
<s> i had had no wedding ceremony no witnesses no certificate of marriage but i had all the joy that goes with them </s>
<s> johnnie rose on one elbow </s>
<s> i took great comfort from his words and smiled to myself in the darkness </s>
<s> infinite peace complete contentment </s>
<s> i felt no conflict between what i was doing and my strict religious upbringing </s>
<s> i had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids and many times i had thought about my love for johnnie who being thirty brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about </s>
<s> i had also thought a lot about how god must look on true love and so in a way i was keeping my promise to god my promise to remain pure until i was married </s>
<s> i was practically a bride after all </s>
<s> there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible </s>
<s> of this i had no doubt </s>

<s> just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children as any decent man would that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too </s>
<s> no price is too high when true love is at stake </s>
<s> and i had no doubts about how true this love was </s>
<s> he was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman and i figured that emotionally i was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half </s>
<s> after all lucille warren was a husband-stealer from way back </s>

<s> convention time in boston </s>
<s> a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow </s>
<s> i had mixed emotions about going </s>
<s> but i had looked forward so much to being with this church group </s>
<s> i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group </s>
<s> so i went to boston </s>
<s> the first meeting was held in faneuil hall a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states </s>
<s> my cousin alma at whose home i was staying during the convention introduced me to a group of young people from rhode island </s>
<s> one of them was a very friendly lovely fellow named ronald a boy about my age with slick blond hair and dancing blue eyes </s>
<s> i thought so and he mentioned it and alma said so too </s>
<s> i assumed alma would get me there but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up we were separated </s>
<s> outside the hall i anxiously looked around for her then all at once there was a hand on my elbow </s>
<s> i went </s>
<s> by the time we arrived the party was already going strong </s>
<s> a couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and i realized they were drinking </s>
<s> but when johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale i enjoyed it </s>
<s> but that was only natural i decided </s>
<s> surely he was still resting snugly in my heart </s>
<s> i drew back </s>
<s> he shrugged </s>
<s> the kitchen was jammed </s>
<s> under normal circumstances he had a certain bright-eyed all-american-boy charm with great appeal for young ladies old ladies and dogs </s>
<s> today he looked like an astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space hollow eyes hollow cheeks hollow stomach </s>
<s> breakfast he thought </s>
<s> a shot of orange juice would make everything seem better </s>
<s> he looked around his little eden bureau bed table chair two-burner stove </s>
<s> then he remembered </s>
<s> in the cold light of day it seemed a lunatic arrangement </s>
<s> he remembered seeing it last night when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables </s>
<s> charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long skinny green pills his spirits as damp as the day </s>
<s> this vacation had seemed like a good idea last week when his doctor had prescribed it </s>
<s> the red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound </s>
<s> this is a sleeping capsule </s>
<s> the others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked </s>
<s> charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment </s>
<s> the doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi </s>
<s> but charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew too that there was no pill to cure it </s>
<s> he had loved and lost vivian wayne to somebody else had watched her marry the somebody else and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever which was really piling it on </s>
<s> he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed distrust of women </s>
<s> in these damp circumstances he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia </s>
<s> he looked up to see mrs kirby awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker bearing down on him </s>
<s> she bellowed triumphantly </s>
<s> he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of pyhrric victory over the tourists </s>
<s> she studied him briefly </s>
<s> charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal peony being less than weatherproof </s>
<s> as for its being fine day after tomorrow he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again with vivian lost to him forever </s>
<s> he dozed only to dream of vivian and woke only to crash into the night table bruising his other shin </s>
<s> his first thought was that mrs kirby in her mania for color had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in </s>
<s> he thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator got the salami bread and a bermuda onion and put the whole thing out of his mind </s>
<s> next morning he found a note in the refrigerator </s>
<s> said this note </s>
<s> everything being the sweater a lipstick case and a squirt bottle of kissin kare pink hand lotion </s>
<s> the note paper was pink too and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine </s>
<s> not that he had supposed considering the evidence that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the beach patrol </s>
<s> must have really smelled up her sweater he thought and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen </s>
<s> but then as he well knew women are not guided by logic or common sense </s>
<s> take vivian </s>
<s> yes take vivian </s>
<s> somebody had </s>
<s> now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would not be pink </s>
<s> they would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid chic and splashy like vivian herself </s>
<s> pink vivian once had told him was for baby girls and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy </s>
<s> he mused aloud </s>
<s> it was mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails </s>
<s> just look at that sky </s>
<s> she scrutinized him </s>
<s> i must remember to warn the girl next to you in larkspur </s>
<s> that pale kind charlie thought </s>
<s> hardly an inviting description </s>
<s> but then neither was peaked </s>
<s> he could hear mrs kirby now warning her pale guest against sunburn </s>
<s> surely there was a better word </s>
<s> charlie looked in the mirror </s>
<s> run-down iron-poor </s>
<s> he looked more closely </s>
<s> clearly two damp days with the bobbsey twins had done him no good </s>
<s> this weekend he thought he would look around for some more subdued retreat with cape roses maybe at the door </s>
<s> the sweater was gone from the refrigerator and in its place was a large plastic bag full of wet pink clothes </s>
<s> no wonder she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes </s>
<s> it gave him a good feeling </s>
<s> not that it was any of her business </s>
<s> he had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper </s>
<s> by the next morning she had turned the paper over </s>
<s> charlie grinned </s>
<s> she sounded a little like a redhead </s>
<s> but then redheads are often pale </s>
<s> he spent that afternoon on the beach looking for a pale browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit </s>
<s> there were pink bathing suits on blondes and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits </s>
<s> there were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits </s>
<s> up on a dune he saw a girl all by herself sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting </s>
<s> on the beach there were pale girls and not-so-pale girls </s>
<s> and he saw them all as he walked up and down </s>
<s> finally in desperation he opened the refrigerator filched her hand lotion and left a note </s>
<s> this was a very warm sympathetic girl he decided </s>
<s> sympathy is a fine quality in a woman </s>
<s> now vivian for instance was not too long on sympathy </s>
<s> she felt and said that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves </s>
<s> it was a tough world and you had to be tough to hold your own </s>
<s> she might peel him once the worst of the agony was over </s>
<s> charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms waiting for the fire in his back to subside and used generous quantities of the hand lotion </s>
<s> correspondence passed back and forth </s>
<s> there are two things here about surviving in the wilderness and a book called tom swift and his speedy canoe </s>
<s> but the picture of tom swift is pretty sinister </s>
<s> there was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot </s>
<s> the new riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop </s>
<s> phil rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay </s>
<s> eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to phil </s>
<s> eddie shouted </s>

<s> the anniston catcher screamed </s>
<s> he jumped to his feet and started to throw punches </s>
<s> mike deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher </s>
<s> this brought in everybody from both sides while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar </s>
<s> the fighters were separated in a few minutes </s>
<s> the game was resumed </s>
<s> but mike deegan was boiling mad now </s>
<s> when the inning was over he cursed the anniston catcher all the way into the dugout </s>
<s> phil rossoff coming in from left field stopped at the water fountain for a drink </s>
<s> mike deegan was standing beside it facing the field </s>
<s> he was eyeing the anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began </s>
<s> mike yelled to the catcher </s>
<s> the anniston catcher did not reply with words </s>
<s> he simply turned to mike and smiled </s>
<s> phil shrugged </s>
<s> he stepped into the dugout wondering why deegan was always looking for trouble </s>
<s> maybe the answer was in his eyes </s>
<s> when deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips </s>
<s> by the time the fielder got his hands on the ball deegan was rounding third base and heading for home </s>
<s> the left fielder threw and it was a good one </s>
<s> but mike had no chance of being tagged </s>
<s> the anniston catcher was straddling home plate </s>

<s> both fell heavily to the ground </s>
<s> only mike got to his feet </s>
<s> he went back to touch home plate turned and walked to the dugout without looking back </s>
<s> the anniston players and their manager ran out on the field </s>
<s> he did not move </s>
<s> then the manager called for a doctor </s>
<s> the riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer </s>
<s> then quickly and a little nervously the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room </s>
<s> mike deegan was sitting on the bench watching </s>
<s> phil rossoff seated next to deegan got up and moved to the other end of the bench </s>
<s> the anniston manager was coming over to the riverside dugout </s>

<s> mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer </s>
<s> no one said a word </s>
<s> the anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of mike </s>
<s> his face was flushed </s>
<s> the anniston manager looked at eddie lee </s>
<s> it was a cold and calculated look </s>
<s> he turned and went back across the field to his dugout </s>
<s> he called in the pitcher who had been pitching and a big heavy powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for anniston </s>
<s> the game started again and in the eighth inning mike deegan came up to bat </s>
<s> everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting </s>
<s> deegan fell into the dirt the ball going over him </s>
<s> he arose slowly and brushed himself off </s>
<s> somebody yelled from the anniston bench </s>

<s> mike deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat </s>
<s> he stood flat-footed in the box but not very close to the plate now </s>
<s> deegan dropped got up turned and holding the bat with both hands up against his chest began to walk slowly out to the mound </s>
<s> the pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards mike deegan </s>
<s> they were both walking towards each other unhurried </s>
<s> riverside and anniston players rushed out on the field </s>
<s> in the next moment it seemed the infield was crowded with spectators ballplayers cops kids and a dog </s>
<s> there was much shouting and screaming </s>
<s> fights sprang up and were quickly squelched </s>
<s> mike and the anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together </s>
<s> phil rossoff and two other riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started </s>
<s> after the game phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when mike deegan came in </s>
<s> phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head </s>
<s> frankie ricco sat down on the bench near phil </s>
<s> the other players were undressing quietly </s>
<s> eddie lee had not come in yet </s>
<s> mike went over to phil and stood over him </s>
<s> mike placed both his hands on his hips </s>
<s> he pushed his jaw forward </s>
<s> and phil banged his locker door shut and spun around </s>
<s> but before anything could happen frankie ricco was between them and eddie lee had come into the dressing room </s>
<s> phil followed eddie into the office and shut the door </s>
<s> phil had to clear his throat </s>
<s> phil stood up </s>
<s> this is the second time </s>
<s> eddie lee leaned forward over the desk </s>
<s> phil shook his head and eddie frowned </s>
<s> suddenly his voice grew hard </s>
<s> phil started to say something but eddie cut him short </s>

<s> phil nodded </s>
<s> frankie nodded </s>
<s> his broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him </s>
<s> when he was twelve he took to reading st augustine and aquinas then lao-tse confucius mencius suzuki hindu tomes by endless krishnaists and numerous socio-archaeological papers </s>
<s> for his birthday because richard had seen them in a store and asked for them his mother bought him the zend-avesta and a little image of the indian god acala </s>
<s> and one day on her own his mother came home with a present entitled the book of the dead which she suspected richard would enjoy </s>
<s> he was enormously happy with her gift and smiled then went to his room to read </s>
<s> grinned his father </s>
<s> his interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian affairs </s>
<s> richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired in his remoteness a thorough if bookish knowledge of asian lore literature life politics and history </s>
<s> he was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of acala and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country </s>
<s> the week at home was not comfortable </s>
<s> his mother who had seen little of him for four years appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an orient which she herself having slight knowledge of it had to be distrusted </s>
<s> she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested </s>
<s> he was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father no matter the subject </s>
<s> as for the book of the dead it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in new york </s>
<s> he had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and trembling at having to open the big furnace given them up to the flames </s>
<s> then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried </s>
<s> richard left america with his clothes his biwa and his image of acala and on the freighter which took him to japan he plucked at the biwa trying to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient japanese tune he had once heard </s>
<s> during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure </s>
<s> he stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty north pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water </s>
<s> it was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind </s>
<s> in tokyo richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in new york except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend </s>
<s> an american student named charlotte adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her </s>
<s> he had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo </s>
<s> in charlotte richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which after a fashion he envied </s>
<s> in time he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity </s>
<s> she convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations </s>
<s> no one had </s>
<s> three of the four persons present all foreign students in tokyo had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy was used as the modifier </s>
<s> soba udon and tea were in because they could be taken noisily </s>
<s> sushi was out because it was pretentious </s>
<s> sashimi was in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to stay out even if it was a little pretentious </s>
<s> richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears </s>
<s> asked a red-haired girl named ceecee witter </s>
<s> sam i thought you knew everything about tokyo </s>
<s> and the man who brought sweet potatoes into kanto is buried there next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo </s>
<s> it was true </s>
<s> fudo the god of wisdom was also thought of as the japanese version of acala </s>
<s> the conversation went on but richard stopped listening </s>
<s> he had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching </s>
<s> perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at ryusenji he was unable to put it together </s>
<s> and the next morning not sure of why he went he took the train to fudomae and walked to ryusenji </s>
<s> he was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte had mentioned </s>
<s> he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool </s>
<s> on the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of fudo or perhaps a demon </s>
<s> the strange creature housed in wire made him shudder </s>
<s> the sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach </s>
<s> he left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him </s>
<s> into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze </s>
<s> but the spirit he wished to call out would not he knew come in the person of the temple priest </s>
<s> instead he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated fudo at their head </s>
<s> then the flames were gone the stillness fell upon the severe black face and richard began to tremble violently </s>
<s> suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated fudo and hurried back down both stairways and away from the temple never looking back </s>
<s> he walked all the miles back to his room </s>
<s> he seemed to have picked up a virus that day because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot </s>
<s> he stayed home reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at ryusenji </s>
<s> the cold lingered making sleep difficult that night and he remained in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal the wretched sound the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life </s>
<s> all of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at fudomae </s>
<s> i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings </s>
<s> the boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath or a stick along to play with </s>
<s> he pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing tractor sounds with his lips </s>
<s> i almost ran over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time </s>
<s> i had turned at the corner of the field and i had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth and i was thinking of the boy and the water anyway and when i looked again down the furrow the snake was there </s>
<s> it lay half in the furrow and half out and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when i put in the clutch </s>
<s> the tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth and the tractor stopped instantly </s>
<s> the snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made into the furrow and did not go any further </s>
<s> he was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly </s>
<s> go out of the furrow snake i said but it did not move at all </s>
<s> i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out hoping to frighten him with the noise but the snake only flicked its black forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern </s>
<s> i let the engine idle then and i got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it </s>
<s> my movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again and its tongue was working very rapidly </s>
<s> the colors were astonishing clear and bright and it was as if the body held a fire of its own and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin vivid and alive and warm </s>
<s> the eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly </s>
<s> his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth </s>
<s> you are much too beautiful </s>
<s> i had killed snakes before when i was younger but there had been no animal like this one and i knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die </s>
<s> i picked him up and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant fire-colored body like splendid ice and i knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him like fieldmice swallowed whole might make </s>
<s> the body caressed through my hands like cool satin and my hands usually tanned and dark were pale beside it and i asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body </s>
<s> i lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool newly-plowed earth from between my pale hands </s>
<s> the snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods </s>
<s> the sharp burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target </s>
<s> i felt good and satisfied looking at the snake </s>
<s> it shone in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself </s>
<s> the color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien too in that dry and dusty and uncolored field </s>
<s> i got on the tractor again and i had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks </s>
<s> i had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house </s>
<s> the earth was a little heavy and i had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake </s>
<s> i saw it all at a glance </s>
<s> the boy was there at the lower corner of the field and he was in the plowed earth stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience </s>
<s> even at that distance with no sound but the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy </s>
<s> i could see the hunched-up shoulders the savage determination the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick </s>
<s> stop it i shouted but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on above anything i could say </s>
<s> i stopped the tractor and i shouted down to the boy and i knew he could hear me for the morning was clear and still but he did not even hesitate in that brutal murdering dance </s>
<s> it was no use </s>
<s> i felt myself tremble thinking of the diamond light of that beauty i had held a few moments before and i wanted to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch the boy in the moment of his savagery and save a glimmer a remnant of that which i remembered but i knew it was already too late </s>
<s> i drove the tractor on not looking down there </s>
<s> i was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on </s>
<s> my head began to ache and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes and i hated the job suddenly and i thought there are only moments when one sees beautiful things and these are soon crushed or they vanish </s>
<s> i felt the anger mount within me </s>
<s> the boy waited at the corner with the jar of water held up to me in his hands and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning </s>
<s> i knew the boy well </s>
<s> he was eleven and we had done many things together </s>
<s> he was a beautiful boy really with finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike and his eyes were blue </s>
<s> he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up as he would smile on any other day </s>
<s> i saw then too the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil through something there where i had been not long before </s>
<s> i stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me </s>
<s> he asked as he often did and i had as often let him be on the tractor beside me </s>
<s> i looked closely at his eyes and he was already innocent </s>
<s> the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his </s>
<s> i pointed to the splintered upright stake </s>
<s> i asked </s>
<s> he tried to take my hand to show me </s>
<s> the boy skipped along beside me and he was contented with what he had done </s>
<s> the fire of the colors was gone </s>
<s> there was a contorted ugliness now </s>
<s> the beautifully-tapered head so delicate and so cool had been flattened as if in a vise and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted torn mouth </s>
<s> the snake was hideous and i remembered even then the cool bright fire of it only a little while before and i thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life </s>
<s> i wrenched the stake out that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body between the colored diamond crystals </s>
<s> i touched it and the coolness the ice-feeling was gone and even then it moved a little perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles and i hoped that it was truly dead so that i would not have to kill it </s>
<s> and then it moved a little more and i knew the snake was dying and i would have to kill it there </s>
<s> the boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips </s>
<s> i took the broken length of it around the tractor and i took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and i struck its head not looking at it to kill it at last for it could never live </s>
<s> the boy came around behind me dragging the stake </s>
<s> he said </s>
<s> i said </s>
<s> he came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes </s>
<s> i could have slapped the boy </s>
<s> he looked up at me puzzled and he swayed his head from side to side </s>
<s> i thought you little brute you nasty selfish little beast with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes </s>
<s> i wanted to slap his face to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth and i decided then very suddenly what i would do </s>

<s> yet the whole of anne was something she had never learned in any college </s>
<s> anne had it </s>
<s> she said what she meant and let it be </s>
<s> she never got on his back </s>
<s> he could take the advice or leave it </s>
<s> he whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator </s>
<s> cady looked at tom who had taken him up and down for fifteen years </s>
<s> when i went to college they begged you to come </s>
<s> be our guest </s>
<s> tom slid open the door to the lobby </s>
<s> always messing around with science stuff </s>
<s> real bright along those lines you might say </s>
<s> as he drove home through the thinning traffic cady felt the unease growing </s>
<s> they had all turned down his son </s>
<s> weakness in leadership </s>
<s> so sorry </s>
<s> limited interests </s>
<s> so sorry </s>
<s> no clear motivation </s>
<s> so sorry </s>
<s> he suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the martini anne had waiting for him </s>
<s> but tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket </s>
<s> nor did looking at anne ease the tension as it usually did </s>
<s> he liked looking at anne </s>
<s> most people did </s>
<s> he liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose </s>
<s> from those navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as david did </s>
<s> she always could sense the shag end of a woolly day </s>
<s> cady deep in thought neither heard nor answered </s>
<s> david grinned </s>
<s> dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else slowly methodically and with interest </s>
<s> cady begged the question </s>
<s> dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys </s>
<s> dave kissed her lightly </s>
<s> get my old man to bed early </s>
<s> anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot </s>
<s> cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined room </s>
<s> your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it </s>
<s> they want a letter from me on his motives interests and leadership </s>
<s> cady handed her the letter drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence </s>
<s> cady stuck his jaw out </s>
<s> no cady he made second team </s>
<s> astronomy </s>
<s> he was mad about stars at the age of nine </s>
<s> geology you and dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago </s>
<s> anne smiled </s>
<s> even in that he never solos like jack on guitar or rich on sax </s>
<s> he keeps the beat going </s>
<s> cady appeared slightly mollified </s>
<s> anne laughed and cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck </s>
<s> anne folded the worrisome document </s>
<s> cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel </s>
<s> for once cady partlow wished anne would yell at him so he could yell back </s>
<s> anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild </s>
<s> cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder </s>
<s> he never will cady </s>
<s> not the kind of leadership you mean working with lots of people </s>
<s> cady walked the block to the mailbox almost ashamed of himself for arguing with anne </s>
<s> martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all </s>
<s> and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions </s>
<s> the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life </s>
<s> lying awake at night he could see them laid out on the floor of his mind </s>
<s> when he rose in the morning the image was still there </s>
<s> he had always been a messy and negligent man </s>
<s> in his bachelor days his bedroom had been strewn with clothes which his mother or later the hotel maid generally saw fit to put in order </s>
<s> no doubt dolores resented following in their footsteps </s>
<s> but it was fun those first days kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug </s>
<s> there was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up </s>
<s> half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things </s>
<s> he remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room at a party </s>
<s> the smooth curve of her neck very white against hair which curled against it like petals </s>
<s> so he sought her out and spoke to her and thought of his hand in her hair </s>
<s> or against her back pressed on the column of vertebrae which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises like the snapped stem of a tulip </s>
<s> but to put it bluntly nothing snapped </s>
<s> yet that had not seriously troubled him not then </s>
<s> they married </s>
<s> more he could take at leisure </s>
<s> he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly </s>
<s> there was too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting </s>
<s> they had left themselves too much to discover </s>
<s> but at the start his new life felt invigorating </s>
<s> good </s>
<s> martin gave her a teasing pat </s>
<s> in the morning the shorts were where he had left them </s>
<s> he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till dolores did </s>
<s> it was almost too easy </s>
<s> for he had just remembered tonight they were having their first guests </s>
<s> the shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening </s>
<s> he was wrong </s>
<s> the rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts </s>
<s> they gave the room a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face </s>
<s> he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute thinking he would get nervous </s>
<s> quietly he determined to foil her </s>
<s> i can be as stubborn as she can he thought </s>
<s> my nerves are as strong </s>
<s> it rang </s>
<s> ten minutes early </s>
<s> martin was standing a few feet from the front door </s>
<s> he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet away </s>
<s> dolores stood motionless in the doorway </s>
<s> he could not cross the living room brush past her and bend down to retrieve the shorts </s>
<s> martin turned his back </s>
<s> he strode to answer the bell </s>
<s> with the most casual and relaxed manner in the world dolores led anthea to the bedroom </s>
<s> martin strained his ears </s>
<s> at first he could not be sure </s>
<s> then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there </s>
<s> a glissade of giggles slid over their voices </s>
<s> all evening anthea favored him with odd coy looks </s>
<s> for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic </s>
<s> at last there was a void no one could fill </s>
<s> the brainards went home early </s>
<s> as violently as possible </s>
<s> but he was so taken aback he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in </s>
<s> on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fumed while she stayed calm and adamant </s>
<s> and if he surrendered after raving at her </s>
<s> he shivered </s>
<s> at once </s>
<s> he considered the sober possibility </s>
<s> in his head was the echo of those titters with anthea </s>
<s> there was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean </s>
<s> he remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women friends lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs where he crouched listening </s>
<s> he could even recall the last time he sat there </s>
<s> the battle had to be fought </s>
<s> let the best sex win </s>
<s> but his resolution hardly seemed to help </s>
<s> if the situation had been bad it now got worse </s>
<s> here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by </s>
<s> these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores showing them around the apartment </s>
<s> of course the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts </s>
<s> it was curious how the different visitors took this </s>
<s> others asked </s>
<s> quite a few laughed </s>
<s> to them all dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale </s>
<s> while he waited in the living room </s>
<s> once martin went along </s>
<s> they entered the bedroom and dolores said nothing </s>
<s> then one of the guests showed his merriment </s>
<s> dolores smiled </s>
<s> she let the interpretation stand </s>
<s> now martin heard himself give a snort of mock good nature </s>
<s> never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment </s>
<s> they kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations </s>
<s> but martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything </s>
<s> he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers </s>
<s> the shorts alone remained </s>
<s> in his moments of worst agony martin imagined what his friends were saying </s>
<s> the sound of their amazement </s>
<s> bizarre he could hear the word </s>
<s> the most bizarre situation </s>
<s> we were up to visit them and </s>
<s> he had thought her exactly what he wanted </s>
<s> pursuing his idea he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now </s>
<s> everyone would know why </s>
<s> he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure </s>
<s> he was trapped </s>
<s> day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself </s>
<s> his mind scurried frantically seeking an exit </s>
<s> alternately he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly morosely to live out his life in this fashion </s>
<s> nothing would change nothing would ever change </s>
<s> when the solution finally came to him one night while he was in bed he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before </s>
<s> in a frenzy of excitement he considered his plan </s>
<s> beside his shorts he would place something of hers </s>
<s> he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor </s>
<s> furthermore he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly every time he went in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere or maybe a girdle next to his shorts </s>
<s> sooner or later dolores would crack </s>
<s> martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story </s>
<s> the tale he thought would become less gay </s>
<s> she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness his lack of control his general male looseness while she remained cool airy and untouched the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body </s>
<s> to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd </s>
<s> something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he believed in it since his courage and virility were involved because it was truly his </s>
<s> the knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism </s>
<s> the next morning while dolores was out of the room he went to her bureau drawer took out a pair of nylon lace pants and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts </s>
<s> he sat down on the bed </s>
<s> in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared </s>
<s> to his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two garments </s>
<s> slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers then hesitated for about a second </s>
<s> he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him </s>
<s> extending her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and swiftly left the room </s>
<s> she did not look at him but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady </s>
<s> they breakfasted together but martin did not refer to his triumph and dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible </s>
<s> he left for work in high spirits </s>
<s> as he relaxed that day martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks </s>
<s> as a prominent industrialist you ought to be interested in his nibs support group </s>
<s> once it was william thought </s>
<s> but not any more </s>
<s> a rush of memory swept him back and he forgot cap </s>
<s> simply enough through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law </s>
<s> freddy needed a job having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by gerry and it was up to arthur willis to provide him with one </s>
<s> mr willis bought zenith plastic products a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long island engaged in working out government contracts and installed freddy in an executive position </s>
<s> shortly after freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas </s>
<s> willis listened patiently and once in a while william was exposed to them at a family gathering </s>
<s> probably mr willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren </s>
<s> another factor must have been the eventual disposal of willis fortune </s>
<s> she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with freddy the more likely he was to reward freddy richly upon his death </s>
<s> whatever the reasons willis and bryan started expanding zenith </s>
<s> since they were hunting for national defense contracts adam herberet a man of surprising resources entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections </s>
<s> feeling his power freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer </s>
<s> heavy industry slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers attracted him </s>
<s> the allstates auto company a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment had recently constructed an over-large modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism </s>
<s> at that point william came into the picture </s>
<s> although not much desiring the account he had been appointed advertising head of zenith </s>
<s> freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner his work in new york had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure </s>
<s> mr willis eager to have him allied with the family wanted advice beyond the confines of his field and william set out on a serious study of the situation including trips to wisconsin and washington </s>
<s> i know a guy named jack hamrick a very bright young engineer who was with chrysler and i took him with me to allstates </s>
<s> the conversion will cost a fortune </s>
<s> i think adam herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side </s>
<s> missiles have thrown everything up for grabs and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here </s>
<s> this means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough </s>
<s> willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged </s>
<s> and gerry </s>
<s> freddy is deeply committed to our plans already </s>
<s> he assures me he has people to handle the money raising and ham richert my lawyer says the legal aspects of the wedding of zenith and allstates are no problem </s>
<s> willis laughed </s>
<s> let me think about it </s>
<s> allied to them was gerry devoting much time to swaying her father and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william was unwilling to interfere further </s>
<s> zenith absorbed allstates stock transfers were arranged and freddy became president of the hyphenated combination </s>
<s> through jack hamrick william fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for shoals and clay </s>
<s> he forgot about a-z till unhappily he and hamrick were proved correct </s>
<s> the wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant </s>
<s> stock willis held in abundance fell sharply in value </s>
<s> confronted by a grim future freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation </s>
<s> once more willis summoned william </s>
<s> william spent a long week end closeted with hamrick </s>
<s> he thought the financing the advertising the production of new models the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult </s>
<s> then he caught fire </s>
<s> if a-z could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment if william could hit precisely the right promotion note if the money hurdle was not insurmountable </s>
<s> they took nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics and put their arguments down in black and white </s>
<s> taking hamrick with him william went to mr willis </s>
<s> he was surprised and dubious but impressed by the engineer and the report </s>
<s> i wish i was younger and less timid </s>
<s> he paused </s>
<s> i hate that </s>
<s> at the meeting attended by freddy richert herberet and the a-z executive staff with mr willis presiding william and hamrick did indeed run the gantlet </s>
<s> from shock and incredulity most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity </s>
<s> william said </s>
<s> sure ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the big three </s>
<s> look what those little european jobs are doing </s>
<s> he swayed them somewhat but the debate raged on </s>
<s> financing emerged as the main obstacle </s>
<s> mr willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum </s>
<s> nothing has been lost </s>
<s> a silence fell </s>
<s> heads instinctively turned in willis direction </s>
<s> he smiled at william and slowly rubbed his hands together </s>
<s> across the table hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger </s>
<s> nobody else showed pleasure </s>
<s> spike-haired burly red-faced decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an ivy league suit jack hamrick awaited william at the officers club </s>
<s> it was among these that hinkle identified a photograph of barco </s>
<s> on their way they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants </s>
<s> finally at ye olde gasse filling station on avocado avenue they learned that their man having paused to get oil for his car had asked about the route to san diego </s>
<s> they headed in that direction and at san juan capistrano by-the-sea came upon barco sitting in the quaint old spanish mission drive-in eating a hot tamale </s>
<s> the robe however was missing for by that time barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in glendale </s>
<s> the detectives placed barco under arrest and without informing him of the nature of the charge took him back to hollywood for questioning </s>
<s> thus it was that barco apprehended for mere larceny now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered </s>
<s> however while in his cell awaiting trial for theft barco in a fit of apprehension made an attempt to take his own life </s>
<s> the attempt had failed because when endeavoring to cut his wrists this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood </s>
<s> but the old fellow a lifelong teetotaler refused it and no more was thought of the matter </s>
<s> then it was that district attorney welch entered the case </s>
<s> a man of vaulting ambition with one eye on the mayorship of los angeles nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity </s>
<s> welch wanted to know why </s>
<s> no one knew </s>
<s> now welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at </s>
<s> the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test </s>
<s> so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly </s>
<s> at first barco was evasive and shifty </s>
<s> by the time barco reached the count of three the situation seemed to welch almost too good to be true </s>
<s> but if true it was the case of which he had dreamed the case which would throw him into headlines all over america as the hero of a great murder trial </s>
<s> it required strength bravado daring to commit murder </s>
<s> his manhood had been attacked </s>
<s> he stiffened and rose to his feet </s>
<s> he queried </s>
<s> for indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it even in hollywood </s>
<s> the searching party consisted of the police captain welch barco policemen with shovels newspaper reporters and cameramen </s>
<s> barco his state of apprehension gone never to return had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on </s>
<s> he directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near santa monica </s>
<s> stopping the cars at a fork in the road he got out paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills and indicated a location </s>
<s> orders were given to dig </s>
<s> nothing was found </s>
<s> welch was worried </s>
<s> the police captain chortled </s>
<s> with greater precision he again paced off a location this time a little more to the left </s>
<s> with quibs and gibes the policemen again started digging </s>
<s> welch was on edge </s>
<s> the captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object </s>
<s> said the digger </s>
<s> joking stopped and everyone gathered around </s>
<s> welch was wild with delight </s>
<s> now did welch truly become the man of the hour and everything that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph for him </s>
<s> it went to his head and his ambition increased </s>
<s> it was apparent that welch was in cahoots with marshall and would use his power as da to drag every possible sensation into the case </s>
<s> i knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when viola was called to the stand </s>
<s> i studied welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted </s>
<s> he was bitter and resentful toward her personally resentful </s>
<s> i did not rest until i had tracked the mystery down </s>
<s> well here it is </s>
<s> one day over a year before there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel </s>
<s> viola had been urged to attend by telephone and not knowing the host or the character of the party she had gone </s>
<s> she arrived late and as she entered the party noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority </s>
<s> the air was thick with smoke empty bottles were in evidence and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor </s>
<s> and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds </s>
<s> while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which as fate would have it belonged to district attorney welch </s>
<s> as viola sat there a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and as a prank insert rosebuds between the toes </s>
<s> then noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds he made his way to the byzantine room and with his usual dignity mounted the rostrum </s>
<s> the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined </s>
<s> he never rested until he discovered who the culprit was and when he did he vowed vengeance on viola lake if ever the chance came his way </s>
<s> and here it was </s>
<s> by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion </s>
<s> in the first place it was difficult for us to meet </s>
<s> now the czarship had not affected my own sense of social values but mother had attained a reflected glory through it which had opened the doors of los angeles-pasadena society to her </s>
<s> i hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats </s>
<s> but mother insisted for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts </s>
<s> in fact it was not until the king of spain had visited at pickfair that mary and doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate los angeles and pasadena from the hoi-polloi </s>
<s> mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with pasadena debs who had been educated abroad and with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school </s>
<s> however such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world society and even alas to my own mother </s>
<s> i sat and watched proceedings </s>
<s> i realized that hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem but his agony could have been no greater </s>
<s> i was saved from making the decision as the phone rang and the girls were upon me instantly </s>
<s> no matter if your children are at the movies in school visiting their grandmother or on a field trip in some distant city they will be upon you magically within seconds after you pick up the phone </s>
<s> jennie and miranda twined themselves around me murmuring endearments </s>
<s> louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which i was trying to hold the phone claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency </s>
<s> i promised to illustrate the lecture if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed </s>
<s> speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller i resumed my everyday voice </s>
<s> under the circumstances i had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone but when i hung up i was reasonably certain that francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening and how important it was that hank and i be there </s>
<s> i discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen and were playing quietly in the living room </s>
<s> it seemed that i would be the gainer if i accepted the peace and quiet instead of carrying out my threats </s>
<s> resolving to get something done i started in on the dishes </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink </s>
<s> they looked so formidable however so demanding that i found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again this time about francesca and her husband </s>
<s> how about them i thought </s>
<s> francesca and herbert were among the few people we knew in catatonia </s>
<s> she was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and having arrived in new york with a big bank roll became a dabbler in various fields </s>
<s> they were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers and then they honeymooned in bermuda </s>
<s> no not bermuda </s>
<s> bermuda was not in style that year </s>
<s> they had honeymooned in rome </s>
<s> everyone was very high on rome that year </s>
<s> they had bought their house in catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding new york </s>
<s> they had chosen catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools beaches and abundance of names </s>
<s> it was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room paint in the painting room play with blocks in the block house and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time </s>
<s> fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against the catatonia uniform of bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by wearing bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in colors </s>
<s> bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes </s>
<s> sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid unrelieved black and with her blonde hair cut so closely wearing this uniform she strongly resembled a member of the ss </s>
<s> no one could dislike them i thought </s>
<s> sometimes though they did not seem quite human </s>
<s> it seemed indeed that their house was not so much a home but rather a perfect stage set and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play and had talent enough to fill the roles competently with nice understatement </s>
<s> even brand names </s>
<s> besides francesca there was blanche </s>
<s> francesca was pleasant and charming but blanche was sweet </s>
<s> anyone knows how a real red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe </s>
<s> if blanche had been honest she would have yelled slammed at least a couple of doors and thrown a few little valueless things </s>
<s> but dear me no </s>
<s> not blanche </s>
<s> francesca and grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen equal bosses of whatever pta or civic project was being launched </s>
<s> they were inseparable not because they were fond of each other but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other as they were keen rivals for social leadership </s>
<s> grazie was mean quietly mean and bitterly unfunnily sarcastic </s>
<s> grazie had a small slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast </s>
<s> she lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration appointments paint and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring </s>
<s> the pets were a couple of siamese cats </s>
<s> her uniform was of rich raw silk in a shade which matched her hair skin housepaint and cats and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless she rather resembled a frozen fish stick </s>
<s> the husbands of these women and others i had met in catatonia were distinguished only in that they were to me at least indistinguishable </s>
<s> like herbert they were all in communications radio television magazines and advertising </s>
<s> one or two were writers of books </s>
<s> all were fellows of finite charm </s>
<s> in deference to country-squirehood </s>
<s> in real life </s>
<s> these boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs while they gazed misty-eyed with care into the eyes of the person they were meeting </s>
<s> pioneers </s>
<s> people who thought it was nice to be important but not important to be nice </s>
<s> who were more ingratiating than gracious more personalities than persons </s>
<s> in my estimation they were people who read daphne du maurier and discussed kafka </s>
<s> reverently and raised their eyes as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about kafka which they were because they had no opinions about kafka not having read kafka </s>
<s> they were i felt people invariably trying to prove not who but what they were and trying to determine what not who others were </s>
<s> becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime i brought myself back to the tasks at hand </s>
<s> then i remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the last week </s>
<s> jennie had shouted each time </s>
<s> the cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills mama had been providing </s>
<s> needless to say i was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free enterprise </s>
<s> i was also publicly reprimanded dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as the new republic the new yorker time and the christian science monitor </s>
<s> it was then that i availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional </s>
<s> the litigation was costly and seemingly endless </s>
<s> i was ready like portia to present my own brief </s>
<s> again my name was on all the front pages </s>
<s> i was it seemed persona non grata in every quarter but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence </s>
<s> traitor indeed </s>
<s> needless to say my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period </s>
<s> i tried my hardest with little help may i say from my husband and leading man but somehow the outside pressures were too severe </s>
<s> never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw </s>
<s> and at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls with the commonest of accents telephoned to announce to me that letch had sired their unborn children </s>
<s> letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter </s>
<s> her presence only made letch more distant and irritable and in the hurry of buying chateau belletch i had neglected to consider a room for baby-dear so there was no place to put her anyhow </s>
<s> it almost always works out for the best </s>
<s> yet i adored this man letch feeley why i cannot say </s>
<s> with faint heart and a brave smile i endured his long absences from chateau belletch his coldness his indifference his slights and his abuse </s>
<s> these are but a sampling of the insults i endured </s>
<s> he did not </s>
<s> he made many tasteless irreverent and unfunny remarks not only about me in the title role but about religion in general </s>
<s> by the time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about mother cabrini </s>
<s> thanks to letch feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me the notices were few and unfavorable </s>
<s> but it was small consolation </s>
<s> it turned out to be a life of martin luther of all things </s>
<s> it was a disaster </s>
<s> in clothes letch simply did not project </s>
<s> he was laughed off the screen </s>
<s> my heart was not in it but oddly enough it remains the most financially successful picture of my career </s>
<s> letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before </s>
<s> i really loved that boy and in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful wonderful person letch had once been i took my troubles to momma hoping that her earthy advice would help me </s>
<s> her reply stung me but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference </s>
<s> the difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately </s>
<s> as a result life had become a kind of continuous make-ready </s>
<s> once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention he could undertake the things which really counted </s>
<s> then at last his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon accompanied by his dogs </s>
<s> he had almost forgotten them although they had played such an important part in his early dreams </s>
<s> then they had always been romping around him on these walks yelping with delight dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws </s>
<s> now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture </s>
<s> it worried him this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day </s>
<s> he would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it </s>
<s> it might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely like lizards in the sun too indolent to blink their eyes </s>
<s> perhaps it was his misfortune or good fortune whichever way one looked at it to belong to the former group and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none which was positively antagonistic to it </s>
<s> there was no compulsion behind them </s>
<s> they could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn </s>
<s> during all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done </s>
<s> this habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting </s>
<s> he looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch </s>
<s> it was five minutes after four </s>
<s> on some distant farm a rooster crowed and far down the valley an associate answered </s>
<s> he turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn </s>
<s> at least he could buy the equipment for his workshop </s>
<s> thus committed action might follow </s>
<s> he also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools and lumber for his workbench sandpaper and glue and assorted nails levels and t squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for </s>
<s> best not to get everything at once </s>
<s> after all if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that </s>
<s> when he returned home the station wagon loaded with tools jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village using the recently purchased second car </s>
<s> he was glad </s>
<s> it gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments </s>
<s> he had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable </s>
<s> he piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall </s>
<s> that was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools </s>
<s> in front of it would be his workbench </s>
<s> after the pegboard there would be the paneling </s>
<s> he sat down on an old box and focused on the problem </s>
<s> perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget </s>
<s> it all seemed rather hopeless </s>
<s> he turned his attention to the workbench </s>
<s> perhaps that was the first thing to do </s>
<s> mr mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which properly handled would he had assured him turn into a workbench </s>
<s> they lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile </s>
<s> mr crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot </s>
<s> then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on </s>
<s> after that everything should be simpler </s>
<s> he went upstairs to phone crumb </s>

<s> mr crumb was laid up with a bad cold </s>
<s> the only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job </s>
<s> there was a fellow named blatz over smithtown way </s>
<s> nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk </s>
<s> mr crumb would probably see him at lodge meeting the next night </s>
<s> while mr blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench mr crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar </s>
<s> mr blatz agreed that this would be pretty </s>
<s> without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling which he then stained and waxed according to his taste </s>
<s> it all did look very efficient and shipshape </s>
<s> there was no question of that </s>
<s> i guess you know about that </s>
<s> instead of being depressed by this news mr crombie was actually relieved </s>
<s> at least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools </s>
<s> he followed mr blatz up the cellar stairs </s>
<s> as usual mrs crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils </s>

<s> ambiguity </s>
<s> nothing in english has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences </s>
<s> there are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology parisology and other ologies </s>
<s> one species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition </s>
<s> such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours </s>
<s> ambiguity of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in </s>
<s> another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician </s>
<s> questions like this framed in verbal fog are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician </s>
<s> similarly when a reporter once questioned lincoln in cryptic fashion lincoln refused to make any further statement </s>
<s> the obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks </s>
<s> replied the senator </s>
<s> the misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach </s>
<s> this creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word </s>
<s> when radio came in it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device </s>
<s> in recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline </s>
<s> journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips </s>
<s> classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions </s>
<s> since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples </s>
<s> many shapes in bathtubs </s>
<s> apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter </s>
<s> the newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical </s>
<s> samples he walked in upon her invitation </s>
<s> she kissed him passionately upon his reappearance </s>
<s> he kissed her back </s>
<s> not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese </s>
<s> in news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs </s>
<s> the double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device as in the gags of weber and fields </s>
<s> strangely enough this always brought the house down </s>
<s> apart from journalese and vaudeville gags the anatomical is also found in jocular literature </s>
<s> a conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor </s>
<s> there are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations </s>
<s> at the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving </s>
<s> the maid demurred </s>
<s> but since the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners the girl reluctantly agreed </s>
<s> so she brought the fish in whole and she carried a lemon in her mouth </s>
<s> another specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department store </s>
<s> this saleslady was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department </s>
<s> the comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy </s>
<s> one species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person place time or thing </s>
<s> a woman met a famous author at a literary tea </s>
<s> this baffling lack of distinct details recalls the secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence </s>

<s> indefinite reference also carries double-meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another </s>

<s> he asked </s>
<s> the manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally indefinite </s>
<s> she inquired </s>
<s> she continued </s>
<s> there was a short pause for reflection </s>
<s> another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb </s>
<s> when a question contains two verbs the response does not make clear which of them is being answered </s>
<s> the moonlit night was made for romance and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time </s>
<s> replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre </s>
<s> in the comedy of indefinite reference it-wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence </s>
<s> ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference </s>
<s> two friends were talking </s>
<s> the speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold </s>
<s> it-wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as well as wit </s>
<s> my husband is in great pain </s>
<s> my unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in terms of speed momentum weightlessness or distance from earth but is a matter of the development of the human mind </s>

<s> arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area </s>

<s> and so they were consistently true to their principles </s>
<s> asked the children whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable </s>
<s> maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of arlene </s>
<s> and when they had got to their little lawn they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time </s>
<s> first arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults </s>
<s> asked one of the children </s>
<s> one of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously particularly your very very serious questions </s>
<s> those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest </s>
<s> she would sometimes even get a little hard on you she took you so seriously </s>
<s> but not hard for very long </s>
<s> just long enough to make you feel important </s>
<s> the children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever </s>
<s> their curiosity went happily out of bounds </s>
<s> then arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful </s>
<s> she held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked </s>
<s> they both laughed and winked back </s>
<s> and she would wink and throw kisses </s>
<s> they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time but it made their lips and eyelids tremble </s>
<s> but they kept on clapping for a long long time </s>
<s> this time it was so grand </s>
<s> they could tell exactly what it was </s>
<s> his legs shook and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders </s>
<s> then there was the general kissing his wife </s>
<s> they had to be told that one </s>
<s> but it was even funnier after they had been told </s>
<s> their father when he came back from those many business trips just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox </s>
<s> but not general burnside </s>
<s> he was the funniest man </s>
<s> then they had to get up and be general burnside </s>
<s> or his horse </s>
<s> all they could think of was to run around in circles kicking their legs out </s>
<s> and they did some somersaults </s>
<s> and arlene showed them how to begin </s>
<s> that helped a lot </s>
<s> they were clumsy but they were beginning to catch on </s>
<s> they also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling </s>
<s> that helped a great deal </s>
<s> they were a little late in getting home </s>
<s> my mother constituted herself the voice of all of us </s>
<s> the children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters </s>
<s> and arlene began tapping the kitchen door open </s>
<s> but he said it too soon for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded </s>
<s> that tap had a slight bangish quality </s>
<s> her upper lip lifted slightly </s>
<s> she was biting into a small red radish </s>
<s> and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing </s>
<s> also she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in a neat mean little heap at the white center of the radish </s>
<s> she would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting </s>
<s> it never worked naturally </s>
<s> but it made her look unusual </s>
<s> also when she had bitten off half of the small radish she found the suspense unbearable </s>
<s> and she would snatch the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it </s>
<s> one could hear a very faint ladylike sigh of relief </s>
<s> actually it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it </s>
<s> but the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public </s>
<s> later on the children told her further about somersaulting </s>
<s> she added </s>

<s> he liked children in a loathsome kind of way </s>
<s> the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment </s>
<s> when he had left i could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles laughingly with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action not bothering to look </s>
<s> the children loathed him too </s>
<s> this evening they were pushed in from the breakfast room with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them </s>
<s> we had just sat down </s>
<s> this could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing a horselike balkiness of demeanor </s>
<s> possibly the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration </s>
<s> but at the beginning this stayed just in the air </s>
<s> this happy bulletin convulsed mr gorboduc </s>
<s> he asked between wheezes of laughter </s>
<s> he was forced to wipe his eyes </s>
<s> one of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger </s>
<s> mr gorboduc took a swig of his sherry </s>
<s> he was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs </s>
<s> but this time she was nervous she was open </s>
<s> mr gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> only unfortunately he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command </s>
<s> this nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment </s>
<s> and the other went on to development of the idea </s>
